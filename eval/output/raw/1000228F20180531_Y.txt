1\. The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance from time to time of the

Preferred Stock in one or more series with such designations and such powers,

preferences and rights, and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions

(which may differ with respect to each series) as the Board of Directors may

fix by resolution. The consent, by class or series vote or otherwise, of the

holders of such of the series of Preferred Stock as are from time to time

outstanding shall not be required for the issuance by the Board of Directors

of any other series of Preferred Stock whether or not the powers, preferences

and rights of such other series shall be fixed by the Board of Directors as

senior to, or on a parity with, the powers, preferences and rights of such

outstanding series, or any of them; provided, however, that the Board of

Directors



* * *



may provide in the resolution or resolutions as to any series of Preferred

Stock adopted pursuant to Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH that the consent

of the holders of a majority (or such greater or lesser proportion as shall be

therein fixed) in voting power of the outstanding shares of such series voting

thereon shall be required for the issuance of any or all other series of

Preferred Stock.



2\. Subject to the provisions of Subparagraph 1 of this Paragraph A, shares of

any series of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time as the Board of

Directors of the Corporation shall determine for such consideration as shall

be determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law.



3\. No dividend shall be declared and set apart for payment on any series of

be or have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment, on all shares of

Preferred Stock of each other series entitled to cumulative dividends at the

time outstanding which rank senior to or equally as to dividends with the

series in question, dividends ratably in accordance with the sums which would

be payable on the said shares through the end of the last preceding dividend

period if all dividends were declared and paid in full.



4\. If, upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation,

the assets of the Corporation distributable among the holders of any one or

more series of Preferred Stock which (A) are entitled to a preference over the

holders of the Common Stock upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding up,

and (B) rank equally in connection with any such distribution, shall be

insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount to which the holders of

such shares shall be entitled, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof,

shall be distributed among the holders of each such series of the Preferred

Stock ratably in accordance with the sums which would be payable on such

distribution if all sums payable were discharged in full.



5\. In the event that the Preferred Stock of any series shall be redeemable,

then, at the option of the Board of Directors, the Corporation may, at such

time or times as fixed by a resolution or resolutions of the Board of

Directors as provided in Subparagraph 1 of this Paragraph A of this Article

FOURTH, redeem all, or any number less than all, of the outstanding shares of

elects to retire them, shares that are held as treasury shares but including

shares redeemed and shares purchased and retired, whether through the

operation of a retirement or sinking fund, or otherwise) may have the status

of authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, and may be reissued as a

part of the series of which they were originally a part or be retired and

reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by

resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors or as part of any other

series of Preferred Stock, all subject to the conditions or restrictions on

issuance set forth in any resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of

Directors as provided in Subparagraph 1 of this Paragraph A of this Article

FOURTH providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock.

B. Common Stock:



1\. After the requirements with respect to preferential dividends on the

Preferred Stock (fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph A of

this Article FOURTH), if any, shall have been met and after the Corporation

shall have complied with all the requirements, if any, with respect to the

setting aside of sums as sinking funds or redemption or purchase accounts

(fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph A of this Article

FOURTH), and subject further to any other conditions which may be fixed in

accordance with the provisions of Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH, then and

Directors in its discretion from any assets legally available for the payment

reserve in the manner in which it was created; and



4\. By resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, to designate one or

more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of

the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in such resolution or in the

By-Laws of the Corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and

authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and

affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to

brought before such meeting in accordance with this Second Amended and

Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held at such hour and on such

business day in each year as may be determined by resolution adopted by the

affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. Subject to the

rights of any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders may

be called at any time only at the direction of the Chairman of the Board of

Directors or by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of

the Board of Directors, and shall be called at the request of stockholders

holding more than 10% of the outstanding voting power of the shares entitled

stockholders shall not be called or held otherwise than as herein provided.

Except as otherwise provided by law or by this Second Amended and Restated

Certificate of Incorporation, at any meeting of stockholders of the

Corporation, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority

in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote

at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business

brought before the meeting in accordance with this Second Amended and Restated

Certificate of Incorporation and, a quorum being present, the affirmative vote

of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the

Corporation present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on

the subject matter shall be required to effect action by stockholders unless a

different or minimum vote is required by this Second Amended and Restated

Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws of the Corporation, the rules or

regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or any law or

regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, in which case such

different or minimum vote shall be the applicable vote on the matter;

provided, however, that the By-laws of the Corporation may establish

alternative procedures and voting standards for the election of directors, as

permitted by law. Election of directors need not be by written ballot. At

every meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or, in

For the purpose of this Article SEVENTH, the term person shall mean any

corporation, partnership, association, trust, estate, firm, individual, or

other entity.



The affirmative vote of 60% or more of all outstanding stock of the

Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required for the amendment of

EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the

Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the

Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable

jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary

way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the

application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under

the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any

receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of

Section 279 of Title 8 of the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of

the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may

be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in

number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or class of

creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the

Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to

any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or

arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization

shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made,

be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the

stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be,

and also on the Corporation.



NINTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its

stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by such

director as a director, provided that this Article NINTH shall not eliminate

or limit the liability of a director (a) for any breach of such directors

duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or

omissions of such director not in good faith or which involve intentional

misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the General

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (d) for any transaction from

which such director derived an improper personal benefit; nor shall this

Article NINTH eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or

omission occurring prior to the date this Article NINTH originally became

effective. If the General Corporation Law of the



5



* * *



State of Delaware is amended after approval by the stockholders of this

Article NINTH to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting

the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the

Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by

the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended from time

to time.



TENTH:



A. Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or

is involved in any pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether

civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding),

by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the

legal representative, (1) is or was a director or officer of the Corporation

or (2) is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,

officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,

trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit

plans (whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official

capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity

while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent), shall be indemnified

and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may

hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including

attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts

paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered

by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue

as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and

shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;

provided, however, that, except as provided in Paragraph B hereof, the

Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in

connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only

if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors

of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article

TENTH shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the

Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance

of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the General Corporation

Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred

by a director or officer in his capacity as such (and not in any other

capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director

or officer, including, without limitation, service with respect to an employee

benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be

made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf

of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall

ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be

indemnified under this Article TENTH or otherwise. The Corporation may, by

action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and

agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing

indemnification of directors and officers.



B. If a claim under Paragraph A of this Article TENTH is not paid in full by

the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by

the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against

the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful,

the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such

claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought

to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in

advance of its final



6



* * *



disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been

tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of

conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount

claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.

Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,

independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination

prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant

is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of

conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor

an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,

a committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the

claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense

to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the

applicable standard of conduct.



C. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in

defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this

Article TENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may

have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of

incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested

directors or otherwise.



D. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to

protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation

or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against any such

expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the

power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under

the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.



ELEVENTH: Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an

alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to

the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1)

any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (2)

any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current

or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation

to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (3) any action asserting

a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of

the State of Delaware, this Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the

Corporation or as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of

Delaware, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs

doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding

any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to

have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article ELEVENTH.



TWELFTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, modify or repeal any

provisions contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of

Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, subject to the

express provisions hereof and all rights and powers conferred herein on

stockholders, directors, officers or others are granted subject to this

reservation.
