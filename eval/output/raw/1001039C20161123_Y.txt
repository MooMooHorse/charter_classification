CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION



  



OF



SERIES A VOTING PREFERRED STOCK



  



OF



  



THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY



  



(Pursuant to Section 151 of the Delaware General Corporation Law)



  



  



THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “Corporation”), DOES

HEREBY CERTIFY that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors

of the Corporation (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”) by the Restated

Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the “Restated Certificate of

Incorporation”) and in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 of the

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors on

July 9, 1999 adopted a resolution providing for the authorization of a series

of preferred stock as follows:



  



RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of

Directors in accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, the Board hereby creates a series of preferred stock, par value

$.01 per share, of the Corporation and hereby states the designation and

number of shares, and fixes the relative rights, preferences and limitations

thereof, as follows:



  



Designation and Amount. The designation of the series of the preferred stock

shall be “Series A Voting Preferred Stock” and the number of shares

constituting the Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be 237,310. Such number

of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of

Directors; provided, however, that no decrease shall reduce the number of

shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of

shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon

the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion

of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into

Series A Voting Preferred Stock.



  



Dividends.



  



(i) Holders of outstanding shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be

entitled to receive cumulative preferential cash dividends, if, as and when

declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefor,

in an amount per annum equal to the product of the “Par Rate” and the

Liquidation Preference (as defined below). The “Par Rate,” which shall be

determined before the closing date (the “Closing Date”) of the transactions

contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of

July 10, 1999 (the “Reorganization Agreement”), by and among Infoseek

Corporation, the Corporation and Bingo Acquisition Corp., based on the advice

of a reputable investment bank selected by the Corporation and shall be a

single fixed rate equal to the highest end of the range of dividend rates at

which the Series A Voting Preferred Stock would be expected to trade at its

Liquidation Preference on or about the Closing Date.



  



(ii) Dividends shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on or before June 30

and December 31 each year or, if not a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday,

that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on



  



1



* * *



  



  



which banking institutions in New York City are authorized or required by law,

regulation or executive order to close (each, a “Business Day”), then the next

succeeding Business Day (each, a “Dividend Payment Date”), commencing on first

June 30 or December 31 following the Closing Date. The amount of dividends

payable on the Series A Voting Preferred Stock for each full semi-annual

period from, and including the applicable Divided Payment Date to, but

excluding the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date (each, a “Dividend

Period”), shall be computed by dividing by two the annual dividend rate set

forth in paragraph (i) above. Dividends payable in respect of the period

between the date the Corporation first issued shares of Series A Voting

Preferred Stock (the “Initial Issue Date”) and the first Dividend Payment Date

thereafter (the “Initial Dividend Period”) and any subsequent period between

Dividend Payment Dates which is less than a full Dividend Period in length

will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day

months. Dividends shall be paid to holders of record as their names appear on

the stock register of the Corporation at the close of business on the first

day of the calendar month in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls

or on such other date designated by the Board of Directors for the payment of

dividends that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to such

Dividend Payment Date (each, a “Record Date”). Dividends in respect of any

past Dividend Periods that are in arrears may be authorized and paid at any

time to holders of record on the Record Date thereof. Any dividend payment

made to holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be first credited

against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due which remains payable.



  



(iii) Dividends shall be fully cumulative and shall accrue (whether or not

declared), with additional payments thereon, from the first day of the

Dividend Period in which such dividend may be payable as herein provided on

all shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock issued and outstanding on the

first day of such Dividend Period, except that with respect to the Initial

Dividend Period, such dividend shall accrue from the Initial Issue Date.



  



(iv) All dividends paid with respect to shares of Series A Voting Preferred

Stock pursuant to paragraph (ii) above shall be paid pro rata to the holders

entitled thereto.



  



(v) If at any time the Corporation shall have failed to pay all dividends

which have accrued on any outstanding shares of any other class or series of

preferred stock having cumulative dividend rights ranking on parity with the

shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock at the times such dividends are

payable, no cash dividend shall be declared by the Board of Directors or paid

or set apart for payment by the Corporation on shares of Series A Voting

Preferred Stock unless prior to or concurrently with such declaration,

payment, or setting apart for payment, all accrued and unpaid dividends on all

outstanding shares of such other series of preferred stock shall have been or

be declared, paid or set apart for payment with additional payments thereon,

if any; provided, however, that in the event such failure to pay accrued

dividends is with respect only to the outstanding shares of Series A Voting

Preferred Stock and any outstanding shares of any other class or series of

preferred stock having cumulative dividend rights on parity with the shares of

Series A Voting Preferred Stock, cash dividends may be declared, paid or set

apart for payment, with additional payments thereon, pro rata on shares of

Series A Voting Preferred Stock and shares of such other class or series of

preferred stock so that the amounts of any cash dividends declared, paid or

set apart for payment on shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock and shares

of such other series of preferred stock shall in all cases bear to each other

the same ratio that, at the time of such declaration, payment or setting apart

for payment, all accrued but unpaid cash dividends on shares of Series A

Voting Preferred Stock and shares of such other series of preferred stock bear

to each other. Any dividend not paid pursuant to paragraph (ii) above or this

paragraph (v) shall be fully cumulative and shall accrue (whether or not

declared), with additional payments thereon, as set forth in paragraph (iii)

above, even if such dividend is not paid pursuant to paragraph (vii) below.



  



(vi) (a) Holders of shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be

entitled to receive dividends provided for herein in preference to and in

priority over any dividends, other than dividends



  



2



* * *



  



  



paid in stock ranking junior to Series A Voting Preferred Stock (the “Junior

Stock”) upon any of the Junior Stock.



  



(b) So long as any shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock are outstanding,

the Corporation shall not declare, pay or set apart for payment, any dividend

on any of the Junior Stock (other than dividends paid in such Junior Stock) or

make any payment on account of, or set apart for payment money for a sinking

or other similar fund for, the purchase, redemption or other retirement of,

any of the Junior Stock or any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable

for any of the Junior Stock, or make any distribution in respect thereof,

either directly or indirectly, and whether in cash, obligations or shares of

the capital stock of the Corporation or other property (other than

distributions or dividends in stock to the holders of such stock), and shall

not permit any corporation or other entity directly or indirectly controlled

by the Corporation to purchase or redeem any of the Junior Stock or any

warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable for any of the Junior Stock,

unless prior to or concurrently with such declaration, payment, setting apart

for payment, purchase or distribution, as the case may be, all accrued and

unpaid cash dividends, including additional payments thereon, on shares of

Series A Voting Preferred Stock not paid on the dates provided for in

paragraph (ii) above shall have been or be paid; provided, however, that

nothing contained herein shall prevent the Corporation from repurchasing

shares of the Common Stock (as defined in the Restated Certificate of

Incorporation) as required by law or by the terms of any employee stock

ownership plan of the Corporation.



  



(vii) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, the Board of

Directors may declare and the Corporation may pay or set apart for payment

dividends and other distributions on any of the Junior Stock, and may purchase

or otherwise redeem any of the Junior Stock or any warrants, rights or options

exercisable for any of the Junior Stock, and the holders of the shares of

Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.



  



Liquidation Preference.



  



(i) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series

A Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid in cash

out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its

stockholders (x) a fixed amount per share determined on the Closing Date equal

to 100 multiplied by the higher of (a) the closing price of common stock, par

value $.001 per share (“Infoseek Common Stock”), of Infoseek Corporation as

quoted on the Nasdaq National Market (“Nasdaq”) on July 9, 1999 or (B) the

closing price of Infoseek Common Stock as quoted on Nasdaq on the last trading

date immediately prior to the Closing Date, plus (y) an amount equal to all

accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series A Voting Preferred Stock to the

date fixed for the liquidation (collectively, the “Liquidation Preference”),

before any payment shall be made or any assets distributed to the holders of

any of the Junior Stock. If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient

to pay in full the liquidation payments payable to the holders of outstanding

shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock and any other class or series of

preferred stock having liquidation rights on parity with the shares of Series

A Voting Preferred Stock, then the holders of all such shares shall share

ratably in such distribution of assets in accordance with the amount which

would be payable on such distribution if the amounts to which the holders of

outstanding shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock and all the holders of

outstanding shares of such other series of preferred stock are entitled were

paid in full.



  



(ii) For the purpose of this section, neither the voluntary sale, conveyance,

exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other

consideration) of all or substantially all the property or assets of the

Corporation, nor the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or

more other corporations shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or

winding up, voluntary or involuntary,



  



  



3



* * *



  



  



unless such voluntary sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer shall be in

connection with a dissolution or winding up of the business of the

Corporation.



  



(iii) The sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the

Corporation’s assts or the merger or consolidation of the Corporation which

results in the holders of the Common Stock receiving in exchange for such

Common Stock either cash or notes, debentures or other evidences of

indebtedness or obligations to pay cash or preferred stock of the surviving

entity which ranks on parity with Series A Voting Preferred Stock in

liquidation or dividends shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of the affairs of the Corporation within the meaning of this

section. In the cases of merger or consolidation of the Corporation where

holders of the Common Stock receive, in exchange for such Common Stock, common

stock or preferred stock which is junior in liquidation and dividends to

Series A Voting Preferred Stock in the surviving entity (whether or not the

surviving entity is the Corporation) of such merger or consolidation or

preferred stock of another entity (in either case, such preferred stock to be

received in exchange for Common Stock is herein referred to in this paragraph

(iii) as “Exchanged Preferred Stock”) the Series A Voting Preferred Stock

shall be deemed to be preferred stock of such surviving entity or other

entity, as the case may be, with the same dividend rate and equivalent rights

to the rights set forth herein. In the event of a merger or consolidation of

the Corporation where the consideration received by the holders of the Common

Stock consists of two or more of the types of consideration set forth above,

the holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive

either cash or securities based upon the foregoing in the same proportion as

the holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation are receiving cash or debt

securities, or equity securities in the surviving entity or another entity.



  



Redemption. The Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall not be subject to

redemption.



  



Voting Rights. Except as set forth herein and subject to applicable law, the

holders of shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote

together with the holders of Common Stock and any other class or series of

stock entitled to vote with Common Stock as a single class on all matters to

be voted upon by the Common Stock and shall not have any additional voting or

veto rights. Each holder of shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be

entitled to one hundred (100) votes for each share of such stock held by such

holder.



  



Consent. No consent of holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall be

required for (i) the creation of any indebtedness of any kind of the

Corporation, (ii) the creation of any class of stock of the Corporation

ranking junior as to dividends and upon liquidation to the Series A Voting

Preferred Stock, (iii) any increase or decrease in the amount of authorized

Common Stock or any increase, decrease or change from par value to no par

value or (iv) the taking of any other action of the Corporation, other than

such action as is specifically described herein as requiring the consent of

holders of Series A Voting Preferred Stock or as otherwise required by

applicable law.



  



Transfer. Disney Enterprises, Inc. (“DEI”) shall not transfer, convey or sell

any shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock to any “Related Person” (as

hereinafter defined) and any purported transfer, conveyance or sale to any

Related Person shall be null and void. DEI may, however, transfer, convey or

sell shares of Series A Voting Preferred Stock to any person that is not a

Related Person. For purposes of this section, “Related Person” shall mean the

Corporation and any person that bears a relationship to the Corporation

described in Section 267(b) or Section 707(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of

1986, as amended.



  



Rank. The Series A Voting Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend

rights and rights on liquidation, winding up or dissolution rank (i) on parity

with any other class or series of preferred stock established by the Board of

Directors, the terms of which shall specifically provide that such class or



  



4



* * *



  



  



series shall rank on parity with the Series A Voting Preferred Stock with

respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding up or

dissolution, and (ii) prior to any other equity securities of the Corporation,

including the Common Stock, with respect to dividend rights and rights on

liquidation, winding up or dissolution.



  



Amendment. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall

not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the

powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock

so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of

at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Voting Preferred

Stock, voting together as a single class.
