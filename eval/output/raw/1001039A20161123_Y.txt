restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in such resolution or resolutions

<PAGE>

 

shares of such series and the qualifications,  limitations and restrictions

thereof, which are as follows:



     Section 1.  Designation and Amount.  The shares of such series shall be

                 ----------------------                                  

designated "Series R Preferred Stock" ("Series R Preferred Stock") and the

number of shares constituting such series shall be 1,800,000.  Shares of Series

R Preferred Stock shall have a par value of $.01 per share.



     Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

                 --------------------------- 



     (A) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the

holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,

when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally

available for the purpose, (i) cash dividends in an amount per share (rounded to

the nearest cent) equal to 400 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash

dividends declared or paid on the Common Stock of the Corporation and (ii) a

preferential cash dividend (a "Preferential Dividend"), if any, on the fifteenth

day of January, April, July and October of each year (each a "Quarterly Dividend

Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after

the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series R Preferred

Stock, in an amount equal to $1.00 per share of Series R Preferred Stock less

the per share amount of all cash dividends declared on the Series R Preferred

Stock pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence since the immediately preceding

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend

Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of

Series R Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall, at any time after

the issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series R Preferred Stock,

make any distribution on the shares of Common Stock, whether by way of a

dividend or a reclassification of stock, a recapitalization, reorganization or

partial liquidation of the Corporation or otherwise, which is payable in cash or

any debt security, debt instrument, real or personal property or any other

property (other than cash dividends subject to clause (i) of the immediately

preceding sentence and other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock or

other capital stock of the Corporation and other than a distribution of rights

or warrants to acquire any such share, including any debt security convertible

into or exchangeable for any such share, at a price less than the Current Market

Price of such share), then and in each such event the Corporation shall

simultaneously pay on each then outstanding share of Series R Preferred Stock of

the Corporation a distribution, in like kind, of 400 times (subject to the

provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth) such distribution paid on a

share of Common Stock. The dividends and distributions on the Series R Preferred

Stock to which holders thereof are entitled pursuant to clause (i) of the first

sentence of this paragraph and the second sentence of this paragraph are

hereinafter referred to as "Participating Dividends," and the multiple of cash

and non-cash dividends on the Common Stock applicable to the determination of

the Participating Dividends, which shall be 400, subject to adjustment from time

to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Dividend

Multiple." In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any

dividend or make any distribution on Common Stock payable in shares of Common

Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a combination, consolidation or

reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser

number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such event the Dividend Multiple

thereafter applicable to the determination of the amount of Participating

Dividends which holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock shall be entitled

to receive shall be the Dividend Multiple applicable immediately prior to such

event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of

Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of

which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately

prior to such event.



     (B)  The Corporation shall declare each Participating Dividend at the

same time it declares any cash or non-cash dividend  or distribution on the

Common Stock in respect of which a Participating Dividend is required to be

paid. No cash or non-cash dividend or distribution on the Common Stock in

respect of which a Participating Dividend is required shall be paid or set aside

for payment on the Common Stock unless a Participating Dividend in respect of

such dividend or distribution on the Common Stock shall be simultaneously paid

or set aside for payment on the Series R Preferred Stock.



     (C)  Preferential Dividends shall begin to accumulate on outstanding

shares of Series R Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next

preceding the date of issuance of any shares of Series R Preferred Stock.

Accumulated but unpaid Preferential Dividends shall cumulate but shall not bear

interest.  Preferential Dividends paid on the shares of  Series R Preferred

Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time

accumulated and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-

by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.



                                       2

<PAGE>

 

     Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock

                -------------

shall have the following voting rights:



     (A)  Each share of Series R Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder

thereof to 400 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of

the Corporation.  The number of votes which a holder of Series R Preferred Stock

is entitled to cast, as the same maybe adjusted from time to time as hereinafter

provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Vote Multiple." In the event the

Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock

payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a

combination, consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common

Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each

such case the Vote Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the

number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock

shall be entitled after such event shall be the Vote Multiple immediately prior

to such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the

denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



     (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of

shares of Series R Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock

shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of

stockholders of the Corporation.



     (C)  If at the time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the

election of directors a default in preference dividends on the Series R

Preferred Stock shall exist, the number of directors constituting the Board of

Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the

Series R Preferred Stock, together with the holders of any other series of

Preferred Stock of the Corporation who shall have been granted voting rights to

elect directors upon a default in the payment of dividends by the Corporation

(collectively with the holders of the Series R Preferred Stock, the "Preferred

Stockholders"), shall have the right at such meeting, voting together as a

single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of Common

Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created

directorships. Such right shall continue until there are no dividends in arrears

upon the Series R Preferred Stock. Each director elected by the Preferred

Stockholders (herein called a "Preferred Director") shall continue to serve as

such director for the full term for which he shall have been elected,

notwithstanding that prior to the end of such term a default in preference

dividends shall cease to exist. Any Preferred Director may be removed by, and

shall not be removed without cause except by, the vote of the Preferred

Stockholders, voting together as a single class without regard to series, at a

meeting of the stockholders, or of the Preferred Stockholders, called for the

purpose. So long as a default in any preference dividends on the Series R

Preferred Stock shall exist (i) any vacancy in the office of a Preferred

Director may be filled (except as provided in the following clause (ii)) by an

instrument in writing signed by the remaining Preferred Director and filed with

the Corporation and (ii) in case of the removal of any Preferred Director, the

vacancy may be filled by the vote of the Preferred Stockholders, voting together

as a single class without regard to series, at the same meeting at which such

removal shall be voted. Each director appointed as aforesaid by the remaining

Preferred Director shall be deemed, for all purposes hereof, to be a Preferred

Director. Whenever the term of office of the Preferred Directors shall end and a

default in preference dividends shall no longer exist, the number of directors

constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced by two. For the purposes

hereof, a "default in preference dividends" on the Series R Preferred Stock

shall be deemed to have occurred whenever the amount of accrued dividends upon

the Series R Preferred Stock shall be equivalent to six full quarter yearly

dividends or more and, having so occurred, such default shall be deemed to exist

thereafter until, but only until, all accrued dividends on all shares of Series

R Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been paid to the end of the last

preceding quarterly dividend period.



     (D)  Except as otherwise required by law or set forth herein, holders

of Series R Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their

consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote

with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for the taking of any

corporate action.



     Section 4. Certain Restrictions.

                ---------------------



     (A)  Whenever Preferential Dividends or Participating Dividends are in

arrears or the Corporation shall be in default in payment thereof, thereafter

and until all accumulated and unpaid Preferential Dividends and Participating

Dividends, whether or not declared, on shares of Series R Preferred Stock

outstanding shall have been paid or set aside for payment in full, and in

addition to any and all other rights which any holder of shares of Series R

Preferred Stock may have in such circumstances, the Corporation shall not:



                                       3

<PAGE>

 

          (i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on or

     redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of

     stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

     dissolution or winding up) to the Series R Preferred Stock;



          (ii) declare or pay dividends or make any other distributions on any

     shares of stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series R

     Preferred Stock, unless dividends are paid ratably on the Series R

     Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or

     in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all

     such shares are then entitled;



          (iii) except as permitted by subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph (A),

     redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any

     stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

     dissolution or winding up) with the Series R Preferred Stock, provided that

     the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire

     shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the

     Corporation ranking junior (both as to dividends and upon liquidation,

     dissolution or winding up) to the Series R Preferred Stock; or



          (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of

     Series R Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with

     the Series R Preferred Stock (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

     dissolution or winding up), except in accordance with a purchase offer made

     in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to

     all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after

     consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative

     rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall

     determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among

     the respective series or classes.



     (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to

purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the

Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4,

purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.



     (C)  The Corporation shall not issue any shares of Series R Preferred Stock

except upon exercise of Rights issued pursuant to that certain Rights Agreement

dated as of November 8, 1995 between the Corporation and The Bank of New York

(the "Rights Agreement"), a copy of which is on file at the principal executive

office of the Corporation and shall be made available to holders of record of

Common Stock or Series R Preferred Stock without charge upon written request

therefor addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation.   Notwithstanding the

foregoing sentence, nothing contained in the provisions hereof shall prohibit or

restrict the Corporation from issuing for any purpose any series of Preferred

Stock with rights and privileges similar to, different from, or greater than

those of the Series R Preferred Stock.



     Section 5.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series R Preferred Stock

                 -----------------                                         

purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever

shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof.  The

Corporation shall cause all such shares upon their retirement and cancellation

to become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation

as to series, and such shares may be reissued as part of a new series of

Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of

Directors.



     Section 6.  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  Upon any voluntary or

                 --------------------------------------                        

involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no

distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior

to the Series R Preferred Stock (upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)

unless the holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock shall have received,

subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided, the greater of either (A) $100.00

per share plus an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid dividends and

distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, or

(B) the amount equal to 400 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per

share to holders of Common Stock, or (ii) to the holders of stock ranking on a

party upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up with the Series R Preferred

Stock, unless simultaneously therewith distributions are made ratably on the

Series R Preferred Stock and all other shares of such parity stock in proportion

to the total amounts to which the holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock

are entitled under clause (i) (A) of this sentence and to which the holders of

such parity shares are entitled, in each case upon such liquidation, dissolution

or winding up. The amount to which holders of Series R Preferred Stock shall be

entitled upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation pursuant

to clause (i) (B) of the foregoing sentence is hereinafter referred to as the

"Participating Liquidation Amount," and the multiple



                                       4

<PAGE>

 

of the amount to be distributed to holders of shares of Common Stock upon the

liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation applicable pursuant to

said clause to the determination of the Participating Liquidation Amount, which

shall be 400 subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided, is

hereinafter referred to as the "Liquidation Multiple." In the event the

Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock

payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a

combination, consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common

Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each

such case the Liquidation Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of

the Participating Liquidation Amount to which holders of Series R Preferred

Stock shall be entitled after such event shall be the Liquidation Multiple

applicable immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the

numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event



     Section 7. Certain Reclassifications and Other Events

                ------------------------------------------



     (A)  In the event that holders of shares of Common Stock receive in respect

of their shares of Common Stock any share of capital stock of the Corporation

(other than any share of Common Stock of the Corporation), whether by way of

reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, dividend or other

distribution or otherwise ("Transaction"), then in each such event the dividend

rights, rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the

Corporation and voting rights of the shares of Series R Preferred Stock shall be

adjusted so that after such event the holders of Series R Preferred Stock shall

be entitled, in respect of each share of Series R Preferred Stock held, in

addition to such rights in respect thereof to which such holder was entitled

immediately prior to such adjustment, to (i)  such additional dividends as equal

the Dividend Multiple in effect immediately prior to such Transaction multiplied

by the additional dividends which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be

entitled to receive by virtue of the receipt in the Transaction of such capital

stock, (ii) such additional distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of the Corporation as equal the Liquidation Multiple in effect

immediately prior to such Transaction multiplied by the additional amount which

the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive upon

liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation by virtue of the

receipt in the Transaction of such capital stock, as the case may be, all as

provided by the terms of such capital stock and (iii) such additional voting

rights as equal the Vote Multiple in effect immediately prior to such

Transaction multiplied by the additional voting rights which the holder of a

share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive by virtue of the receipt in

the Transaction of such capital stock.



     (B)  In the event that holders of shares of Common Stock receive in respect

of their shares of Common Stock any right or warrant to purchase Common Stock

(including as such a right, for all purposes of this paragraph, any security

convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) at a purchase price per share

less than the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of a share of Common

Stock on the date of issuance of such right or warrant, then in each such event

the dividend rights, rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of

the Corporation and voting rights of the shares of Series R Preferred Stock

shall each be adjusted so that after such event the Dividend Multiple and the

Liquidation Multiple and the Vote Multiple shall each be the product of the

Dividend Multiple, the Liquidation Multiple and the Vote Multiple, as the case

may be, in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the

numerator at or of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock

outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the

maximum number of shares of Common Stock which could be acquired upon exercise

in full of all such rights or warrants and the denominator of which shall be the

number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of

rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock which could be

purchased, at the Current Market Price of the Common Stock at the time of such

issuance, by the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon exercise in full

of all such rights or warrants.



     (C)  In the event that holders of shares of Common Stock receive in respect

of their shares of Common Stock any right or warrant to purchase capital stock

of the Corporation (other than shares of Common Stock), including as such a

right, for all purposes of this paragraph, any security convertible into or

exchangeable for capital stock of the Corporation (other than Common Stock), at

a purchase price per share less than the Current Market Price of such shares of

capital stock on the date of issuance of such right or warrant, then in each

such event the dividend rights, rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding

up of the Corporation and the voting rights of the shares of Series R Preferred

Stock shall each be adjusted so that after such event each holder of a share of

Series R Preferred Stock shall be entitled, in addition to such rights in

respect thereof to which such holder was entitled immediately prior to such

event, to receive (i) such additional dividends as equal the Dividend Multiple

in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied, first, by the additional

dividends to which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled upon

exercise of such right



                                       5

<PAGE>

 

or warrant by virtue of the capital stock which could be acquired upon such

exercise and multiplied again by the Discount Fraction (as hereinafter defined),

(ii) such additional distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up

of the Corporation as equal the Liquidation Multiple in effect immediately prior

to such event multiplied, first, by the additional amount which the holder of a

share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up of the Corporation upon exercise of such right or warrant by

virtue of the capital stock which could be acquired upon such exercise and

multiplied again by the Discount Fraction and (iii) such additional voting

rights as equal the Vote Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event

multiplied, first, by the additional voting rights to which the holder of a

share of Common Stock shall be entitled upon exercise of such right or warrant

by virtue of the capital stock which could be acquired upon such exercise and

multiplied again by the Discount Fraction. For purposes of this paragraph, the

"Discount Fraction" shall be a fraction the numerator of which shall be the

difference between the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of a share

of the capital stock subject to a right or warrant distributed to holders of

shares of Common Stock as contemplated by this paragraph immediately after the

distribution thereof and the purchase price per share for such share of capital

stock pursuant to such right or warrant and the denominator of which shall be

the Current Market Price of a share of such capital stock immediately after the

distribution of such right or warrant.



     (D)  For purposes of this Section 7, the "Current Market Price" of a share

of capital stock of the Corporation (including a share of Common Stock) on any

date shall be deemed to be the average of the  daily closing prices per share

thereof over the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter

defined) immediately prior to such date, provided that in the event that such

Current Market Price of any such share of capital stock is determined during a

period which includes any date that is within 30 Trading Days after the ex-

dividend date for (i) a dividend or distribution on stock payable in shares of

such stock or securities convertible into shares of such stock or (ii) any

subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, reverse stock split or

reclassification of such stock, then in each such event, the Current Market

Price shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors to reflect the

Current Market Price of such stock to take into account ex-dividend trading.

The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in

case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and

asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principle

consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or

admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the shares are not

listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the

principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities

listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are

listed or admitted to trading or, if the shares are not listed or admitted to

trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so

quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter

market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ") or such other system then in use, or if on

any such date the shares are not quoted by any such organization, the average of

the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker

making a market in the shares selected by the Board of Directors.  The term

"Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities

exchange on which the shares are listed or admitted to trading is open for the

transaction of business or, if the shares are not listed or admitted to trading

on any national securities exchange, on which the New York Stock Exchange or

such other national securities exchange as may be selected by the Board of

Directors is open.  If the shares are not publicly held or not so listed or

traded on any day within the period of 30 Trading Days applicable to the

determination of Current Market Price thereof as aforesaid, "Current Market

Price" shall mean the fair market value thereof per share as determined in good

faith by the Board of Directors.  In either case referred to in the foregoing

sentence, the determination of Current Market Price shall be described in a

statement filed with the Secretary of the Corporation.



     Section 8.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In the event that the Corporation

                 --------------------------                                    

shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in

which shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or

securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such event each

outstanding share of Series R Preferred Stock shall at the same time be

similarly exchanged for or changed into the aggregate amount of stock,

securities, cash and other property (payable in like kind), as the case may be,

for which or into which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged

multiplied by the higher of the Dividend Multiple, the Liquidation Multiple or

the Vote Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event.



     Section 9.  Effective Time of Adjustments.

                 ----------------------------- 



     (A)   Adjustments to the Series R Preferred Stock required by the

provisions hereof shall be effective as of the time at which the event requiring

such adjustments occurs.



                                       6

<PAGE>

 

     (B)  The Corporation shall give prompt written notice to each holder of a

share of Series R Preferred Stock of the effect on any such shares of any

adjustment to the dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of the Corporation required by the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding

the foregoing sentence, the failure of the Corporation to give such notice shall

not affect the validity of or the force or effect of or the requirement for such

adjustment.



     Section 10.  No Redemption.  The  shares of Series R Preferred Stock shall

                  -------------                                                

not be redeemable at the option of the Corporation or any holder thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence of this Section, the Corporation may

acquire shares of Series R Preferred Stock in any other manner permitted by law

or the provisions hereof.



     Section 11.  Ranking.  Unless otherwise provided in the Restated

                  --------                                           

Certificate of Incorporation or a Certificate of Designation relating to a

subsequent series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, the Series R Preferred

Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock

as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation,

dissolution or winding up and senior to the Common Stock.



     Section 12.  Amendment.  After the Distribution Date (as defined in the

                  ---------                                                 

Rights Agreement), the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation

shall not be amended in any manner which would materially affect the rights,

privileges or powers of the Series R Preferred Stock without, in addition to any

other vote of stockholders required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders

of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of Series R Preferred Stock, voting

together as a single class.



     FIFTH:  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or

under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than nine

directors nor more than twenty-one directors, the exact number of directors to

be determined from time to time solely by resolution adopted by the Board of

Directors.  The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class

I, Class II and Class III.  Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be

possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire

Board of Directors.  The term of the initial Class I directors shall terminate

on the date of the 1997 annual meeting of stockholders; the term of the initial

Class II directors shall terminate on the date of the 1998 annual meeting of

stockholders; and the term of the initial Class III directors shall terminate on

the date of the 1999 annual meeting of stockholders.  At each annual meeting of

stockholders, beginning with the 1997 annual meeting of stockholders, successors

to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be

elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of

stockholders. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease

shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors

in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional directors of any

class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall

hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that

class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the

term of any incumbent director.  A director shall hold office until the annual

meeting for the year in which his term expires and until his successor shall be

elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation,

retirement, disqualification or removal from office.  Any vacancy on the Board

of Directors, howsoever resulting, may be filled solely by a majority of the

directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining

director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for a term

that shall coincide with the term of the class to which such director shall have

been elected.



     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more

classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the

right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or

special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of

vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the

terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the resolution or

resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article FOURTH

applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into

classes pursuant to this Article FIFTH unless expressly provided by such terms.



     SIXTH: Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred

Stock then outstanding, from and after the time that shares of Common Stock are

first issued, any or all of the directors of the Corporation may be removed from

office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the

holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation then entitled

to vote generally in the election of directors, considered for purposes of this

Article SIXTH as one class.



                                       7

     SEVENTH:  Elections of directors at an annual or special meeting of

stockholders shall be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation

shall otherwise provide.



     EIGHTH:  Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any

purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the

Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President.   Special meetings of the

stockholders of the Corporation may not be called by any other person or

persons.



     NINTH:  A.  Except as set forth in Section B of this Article NINTH, the

affirmative vote of the holders of four-fifths (4/5) of the outstanding stock of

the Corporation entitled to vote shall be required for:



          (i) any merger or consolidation to which the Corporation, or any of

     its subsidiaries, and an Interested Person (as hereinafter defined) are

     parties;



          (ii) any sale or other disposition by the Corporation, or any of its

     subsidiaries, of all or substantially all of its assets to an Interested

     Person;



          (iii) any purchase or other acquisition by the Corporation, or any of

     its subsidiaries, of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of an

     Interested Person; and



          (iv) any other transaction with an Interested Person which requires

     the approval of the stockholders of the Corporation under the GCL.



     B. The provisions of Section A of this Article NINTH shall not be

applicable to any transaction described therein if (i) such transaction is

approved by resolution of the Corporation's Board of Directors, provided that a

majority of the members of the Board of Directors voting for the approval of

such transaction were duly elected and acting members of the Board of Directors

prior to the date that the person, firm or corporation, or any group thereof,

with whom such transaction is proposed, became an Interested Person, or (ii) the

provision of a vote in excess of that required by the GCL for such transaction

violates the express provisions of the GCL.



     C. As used in this Article NINTH, the term "Interested Person" shall mean

any person, firm or corporation, or any group thereof, acting or intending to

act in concert, including any person directly or indirectly controlling or

controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such person, firm

or corporation or group, which owns of record or beneficially, directly or

indirectly, five percent (5%) or more of any class of voting securities of the

Corporation.



     D. The affirmative vote of the owners of four-fifths (4/5) of the

outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote shall be required to

amend, alter or repeal this Article NINTH.



     TENTH: The officers of the Corporation shall be chosen in such a manner,

shall hold their offices for such terms and shall carry out such duties as are

determined solely by the Board of Directors, subject to the right of the Board

of Directors to remove any officer or officers at any time with or without

cause.



     ELEVENTH: A. The Corporation shall indemnify to the full extent authorized

or permitted by law (as now or hereinafter in effect) any person made, or

threatened to be made, a defendant or witness to any action, suit or proceeding

(whether civil or criminal or otherwise) by reason of the fact that he, his

testator or intestate, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or by

reason of the fact that such director or officer, at the request of the

Corporation, is or was serving any other corporation, partnership, joint

venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, in any capacity.

Nothing contained herein shall affect any rights to indemnification to which

employees other than directors and officers may be entitled by law. No amendment

or repeal of this Section A of Article ELEVENTH shall apply to or have any

effect on any right to indemnification provided hereunder with respect to any

acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.



     B. A director of this Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or

its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a

director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation

thereof is not permitted under the GCL.



                                       8

<PAGE>

 

     Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph shall not adversely

affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing

hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or

modification.



     C. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute:



          (i) the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of

     any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the

     Corporation, or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,

     officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint

     venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any

     liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or

     arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would

     have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions

     of law; and



          (ii) the Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security

     interest and/or use other means (including, without limitation, letters of

     credit, surety bonds and/or other similar arrangements), as well as enter

     into contracts providing indemnification to the full extent authorized or

     permitted by law and including as part thereof provisions with respect to

     any or all of the foregoing to ensure the payment of such amounts as may

     become necessary to effect indemnification as provided therein, or

     elsewhere.



     TWELFTH:  In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by

statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, repeal, alter,

amend or rescind the Bylaws of the Corporation.  In addition, the Bylaws of the

Corporation may be adopted, repealed, altered, amended or rescinded by the

affirmative vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the

outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.



     THIRTEENTH:  The Corporation reserves the right to repeal, alter, amend or

rescind any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the

manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred on

stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
