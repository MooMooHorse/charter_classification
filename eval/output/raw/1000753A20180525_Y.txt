other class or classes or of any other series of Preferred Stock or any other

class or classes of stock or other securities of the Corporation, and (vii)

grant such other special rights and impose such qualifications, limitations or

restrictions thereon as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors, to the

extent not inconsistent with this Article FOURTH and to the full extent now or

hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware.



(2) Except as by law expressly provided, or except as may be provided in any

Directors’ Resolution, the Preferred Stock shall have no right or power to

vote on any question or in any proceeding or to be represented at, or to

receive notice of, any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation.



(3) Preferred Stock that is redeemed, purchased or retired by the Corporation

shall assume the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock and may

thereafter, subject to the provisions of any Directors’ Resolution providing

for the issue of any particular series of Preferred Stock, be reissued in the

same manner as authorized but unissued Preferred Stock.



B. Common Stock. All shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation shall be

identical and except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in

the Directors’ Resolution or Resolutions, if any, adopted by the Board of

Directors with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of the

Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power, and each share of

Common Stock shall have one vote.



FIFTH: The number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be

fixed as specified in the Bylaws of the Corporation, but shall not be less

than three or more than 15. The directors shall be divided into three classes,

designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The initial term for directors in

Class I shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1996;

the initial term for directors in Class II shall expire at the annual meeting

of stockholders to be held in 1997; and the initial term for directors in

Class III shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in

1998. Each class of directors shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of

one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of

Directors.



At the expiration of the initial term of each class of directors, and of each

succeeding term of each class, each class of directors shall be elected to

serve until the annual meeting of stockholders held three years from such

expiration and until their successors are elected and qualified or until their

earlier death, resignation, removal or retirement. Any increase or decrease in

the number of directors constituting the Board shall be apportioned among the

classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as near as

possible to one-third the whole number of directors as so adjusted. Any

director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the

remaining term of the class to which such directorship is assigned. No

decrease in the number of directors constituting the Corporation’s Board of

Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any vacancy in the

Board of Directors, whether arising through death, resignation or removal of a

director, or through an increase in the number of directors of any class,

shall be filled by the majority vote of the remaining directors. The Bylaws

may contain any provision regarding classification of the Corporation’s

directors not inconsistent with the terms hereof.



A director of the Corporation may be removed only for cause and only upon the

affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock

of the Corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors, subject to

further restrictions on removal, not inconsistent with this Article FIFTH, as

may be contained in the Bylaws.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes

or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right,

voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or

special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of

vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the

terms of this Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such

directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this

Article FIFTH unless expressly provided by such terms.



SIXTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the

business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further

definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of

its directors and stockholders:



A. The Board of Directors is authorized to alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws

or adopt new Bylaws of the Corporation. The stockholders shall not repeal or

change the Bylaws of the Corporation unless such repeal or change is approved

by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66 2/3 % of

the total voting power of all shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to

vote in the election of directors, considered for the purposes of this

paragraph A as a single class.



B. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws so

provide.



C. In addition to the powers herein or by statute expressly conferred upon the

Corporation’s directors, the Corporation’s directors are hereby empowered to

exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised

or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the

statutes of Delaware, this Certificate of Incorporation, and any Bylaws

adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter

adopted shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been

valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.



D. No action shall be taken by the stockholders except at an annual or special

meeting with prior notice and a vote. No action shall be taken by the

stockholders by written consent.

contained in the statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or

places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in

the Bylaws of the Corporation.

whether or not in connection with the issuance and sale of any of its stock or

other securities, rights (the “Rights”) entitling the holders thereof to

purchase from the Corporation shares of capital stock or other securities. The

times at which and the terms upon which the Rights are to be issued will be

determined by the Board of Directors and set forth in the contracts or

instruments that evidence the Rights. The authority of the Board of Directors

with respect to the Rights shall include, but not be limited to, determination

of the following:



A. The initial purchase price per share of the capital stock or other

securities of the Corporation to be purchased upon exercise of the Rights.



B. Provisions relating to the times at which and the circumstances under which

the Rights may be exercised or sold or otherwise transferred, either together

with or separately from, any other securities of the Corporation.



C. Provisions that adjust the number or exercise price of the Rights or amount

or nature of the securities or other property receivable upon exercise of the

Rights in the event of a combination, split or recapitalization of any capital

stock of the Corporation, a change in ownership of the Corporation’s

securities or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other

occurrence relating to the Corporation or any capital stock of the

Corporation, and provisions restricting the ability of the Corporation to

enter into any such transaction absent an assumption by the other party or

parties thereto of the obligations of the Corporation under such Rights.



D. Provisions that deny the holder of a specified percentage of the

outstanding securities of the Corporation the right to exercise the Rights

and/or cause the Rights held by such holder to become void.



E. Provisions that permit the Corporation to redeem the Rights.



F. The appointment of a Rights Agent with respect to the Rights.



NINTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the

Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary

duty by such director as a director, provided, however, that this Article

NINTH shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director to the extent

provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of

loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not

in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation

of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an

improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this Article NINTH

shall apply to, or have any effect on, the liability or alleged liability of

any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any facts or omissions

of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. If the General

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended to authorize corporate

action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors,

then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or

limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the

State of Delaware, as so amended.
