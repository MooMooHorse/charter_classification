<PAGE>   3

 

             (b) the number of shares of the series, which number may be

          The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt from time to time

     amendments to the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, fixing and

     determining, with respect to each such series, the matters described in

     clauses (a) through (i), inclusive, of this Section 1.

 

          SECTION 2.  The holders of the Serial Preference Stock of each series,

     Serial Preference Stock II and when and as declared by the Board of

     Directors dividends in cash at the rate for such series fixed in accordance

     with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division and no more, payable

     quarterly on the dates fixed for such series. Such dividends shall be

     cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from and after

     the date of issuance thereof. No dividends may be paid upon or declared or

     set apart for any of the Serial Preference Stock for any quarterly dividend

     period unless at the same time (i) a like proportionate dividend for the

     same quarterly dividend period, ratably in proportion to the respective

     annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be paid upon or declared or set

     apart for all Serial Preference Stock of all series then issued and

     outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend, and (ii) the dividend

     payable during the same quarterly dividend period upon all Serial

     Preference Stock II of all series then issued and outstanding at the rate

     and upon the date as fixed and determined by the Board of Directors as

     provided in Section 1 of Division C hereof shall be paid upon or declared

     or set apart for all such Serial Preference Stock II entitled to receive

     such dividend.

 

          SECTION 3.  In no event so long as any Serial Preference Stock shall

     be outstanding shall any dividends, except a dividend payable in Common

     Stock or other shares ranking junior to the Serial Preference Stock, be

     paid or declared or any distribution be made except as aforesaid on the

     Common Stock or any other shares ranking junior to the Serial Preference

     Stock, nor shall any Common Stock or any other shares ranking junior to the

     Serial Preference Stock be purchased, retired or otherwise acquired by the

     Corporation (except out of the proceeds of the sale of Common Stock or

     other shares ranking junior to the Serial Preference Stock received by the

     Corporation subsequent to January 1, 1964):

 

             (a) unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on Serial Preference

        Stock, including the full dividends for the current quarterly dividend

        period, shall have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for

        payment thereof set apart; and

 

             (b) unless there shall be no arrearages with respect to the

        redemption of Serial Preference Stock of any series from any sinking

        fund provided for shares of such series in accordance with the

        provisions of Section 1 of this Division.

          SECTION 4.

 

          (a) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation may

     from time to time redeem all or any part of the Serial Preference Stock of

     any series at the time outstanding (i) at the option of the Board of

     Directors at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in

     accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division, or (ii) in

     fulfillment of the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of

     such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in

     accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division, together in

     each case with accrued dividends to the redemption date.

 

          (b) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid,

     to the holders of record of the Serial Preference Stock to be redeemed at

     their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation,

     and shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation

     in the City of New York, New York, not less than thirty (30) days nor more

     than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for such redemption. At any

     time before or after notice has been given as above provided, the

     Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of the shares of

     Serial Preference Stock to be redeemed with any bank or trust company in

     the City of Cleveland, Ohio, or the City of New York, New York, having

     capital and surplus of more than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), named

     in such notice, directed to be paid to the respective holders of the shares

     of Serial Preference Stock so to be redeemed, in amounts equal to the

     redemption price of all shares of Serial Preference Stock so to be

     redeemed, on surrender of the stock certificate or certificates held by

     such holders, and upon the making of such deposit such holders shall cease

     to be shareholders with respect to such shares, and after such notice shall

     have been given and such deposit shall have been made such holders shall

     have no interest in or claim against the Corporation with respect to such

     shares and shall be entitled only to receive such moneys from such bank or

     trust company without interest. In case less than all of the outstanding

     shares of Serial Preference Stock are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall

     select by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be

     prescribed by its Board of Directors.

 

          If the holders of shares of Serial Preference Stock which shall have

     been called for redemption shall not, within six years after such deposit,

     claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or

     trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such

     unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the

     Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and

     to such holders.

 

          (c) Any shares of Serial Preference Stock which are redeemed by the

     Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4 and any shares of

     Serial Preference Stock which are purchased and delivered in satisfaction

     of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such series and any

     shares of Serial Preference Stock which are converted in accordance with

     the express terms thereof shall be cancelled and not reissued. Any shares

     of Serial Preference Stock otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall

     resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of Serial Preference

     Stock without serial designation.

 

          SECTION 5.

 

          (a) The holders of the Serial Preference Stock of any series shall, in

     case of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the

     Corporation, be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the

     Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or

     distributed among the holders of the Common Stock or any other shares

     ranking junior to the Serial Preference Stock:

 

             (i) in the event of any voluntary liquidation, dissolution or

        winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the amounts fixed with

        respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this

        Division; or

 

             (ii) in the event of any involuntary liquidation, dissolution or

        winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, $100 per share;

 

     plus in either event an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid

     thereon to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such

     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.

     In case the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are

     insufficient to permit

 

                                        3

<PAGE>   5

 

     the payment upon all outstanding shares of Serial Preference Stock and

     Serial Preference Stock II of the full preferential amount to which they

     are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed

     ratably to all outstanding shares of Serial Preference Stock and Serial

     Preference Stock II in proportion to the full preferential amount to which

     each such share is entitled.

 

          After payment to holders of Serial Preference Stock of the full

     preferential amounts as aforesaid, holders of Serial Preference Stock, as

     such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the

     Corporation.

 

          (b) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any

     other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the

     sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property of the

     Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or

     winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this Section 5.

 

          SECTION 6.

 

          (a) The holders of Serial Preference Stock shall be entitled at all

     times to two votes for each share, and, except as otherwise provided herein

     or required by law, the holders of the Serial Preference Stock, the holders

     of Serial Preference Stock II and the holders of Common Stock of the

     Corporation shall vote together as one class on all matters, subject,

     however, to the special voting rights conferred upon the holders of Serial

     Preference Stock II as hereinafter provided in Section 6 of Division C

     hereof.

 

          If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the

     payment of the equivalent of six (6) full quarterly dividends on all shares

     of all series of Serial Preference Stock at the time outstanding, whether

     or not earned or declared, the holders of Serial Preference Stock of all

     series, voting separately as a class and in addition to all other rights to

     vote for Directors, shall be entitled to elect as herein provided, three

     (3) members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided,

     however, that the holders of shares of Serial Preference Stock shall not

     have or exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of the

     shareholders for the election of Directors at which the holders of not less

     than thirty-five per cent (35%) of the outstanding shares of Serial

     Preference Stock of all series then outstanding are present in person or by

     proxy; and provided, further, that the special class voting rights provided

     for herein when the same shall have become vested, shall remain so vested

     until all accrued unpaid dividends on the Serial Preference Stock of all

     series then outstanding shall have been paid, whereupon the holders of the

     Serial Preference Stock shall be divested of their special class voting

     rights in respect of subsequent elections of Directors, subject to the

     revesting of such special class voting rights in the event hereinabove

     specified in this Section.

 

          In the event of default entitling the holders of Serial Preference

     Stock to elect three (3) Directors as above specified, a special meeting of

     the shareholders for the purpose of electing such Directors shall be called

     by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be

     called by, the holders of record of at least ten per cent (10%) of the

     shares of Serial Preference Stock of all series at the time outstanding,

     and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for

     the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation

     shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of

     shareholders shall be held within ninety (90) days after the date of

     receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Serial

     Preference Stock. At any meeting at which the holders of the Serial

     Preference Stock shall be entitled to elect Directors, the holders of

     thirty-five per cent (35%) of the then outstanding shares of Serial

     Preference Stock of all series, present in person or by proxy, shall be

     sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a

     majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall

     be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of

     Directors which the holders of the Serial Preference Stock are entitled to

     elect as hereinabove provided.

 

          (b) The consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the number of

     shares of Serial Preference Stock at the time outstanding given in person

     or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose at

     which the holders of the Serial Preference Stock shall vote separately as a

     class, shall be

 

                                        4

<PAGE>   6

 

     necessary to effect any one or more of the following (but so far as the

     holders of Serial Preference Stock are concerned, such action may be

     effected with such consent):

 

             (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of

        these Articles of Incorporation, as the same may at any time be amended,

        or of the Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely the

        voting powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Serial Preference

        Stock or reduces the time for any notice to which the holders of Serial

        Preference Stock may be entitled; provided, however, that, for the

        purpose of this clause (i) only, neither the amendment of these Articles

        of Incorporation, as the same may at any time be amended, so as to

        authorize or create, or to increase the authorized amount of, Serial

        Preference Stock or of any shares of any class ranking on a parity with

        or junior to the Serial Preference Stock, nor the amendment of the

        provisions of the Regulations so as to increase the number of Directors

        of the Corporation, shall be deemed to affect adversely the voting

        powers, rights or preferences of the holders of the Serial Preference

        Stock; and provided further, that if such amendment, alteration or

        repeal affects adversely the rights or preferences of one or more but

        not all series of Serial Preference Stock at the time outstanding, only

        the consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the number of the

        shares of the series so affected shall be required;

 

             (ii) the authorization or creation of, or the increase in the

        authorized amount of, any shares of any class, or any security

        convertible into shares of any class, ranking prior to the Serial

        Preference Stock; or

 

             (iii) the purchase or redemption (for sinking fund purposes or

        otherwise) of less than all of the Serial Preference Stock then

        outstanding except in accordance with a stock purchase offer made to all

        holders of record of Serial Preference Stock, unless all dividends upon

        all Serial Preference Stock then outstanding for all previous quarterly

        dividend periods shall have been declared and paid or funds therefor set

        apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto shall

        have been complied with.

 

          (c) The consent of the holders of at least a majority of the number of

     shares of Serial Preference Stock at the time outstanding, given in person

     or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose at

     which the holders of the Serial Preference Stock shall vote separately as a

     class, shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the following (but

     so far as the holders of Serial Preference Stock are concerned, such action

     may be effected with such consent):

 

             (i) the sale, lease or conveyance by the Corporation of all or

        substantially all of its property or business or the voluntary parting

        with the control thereof, or its consolidation with or merger into any

        other corporation, unless the corporation resulting from such

        consolidation or merger will have after such consolidation or merger no

        class of shares either authorized or outstanding ranking prior to or on

        a parity with the Serial Preference Stock except the same number of

        shares ranking prior to or on a parity with the Serial Preference Stock

        and having the same rights and preferences as the shares of the

        Corporation authorized and outstanding immediately preceding such

        consolidation or merger, and each holder of Serial Preference Stock

        immediately preceding such consolidation or merger shall receive the

        same number of shares, with the same rights and preferences, of the

        resulting corporation; or

 

             (ii) The authorization of any shares ranking on a parity with the

        Serial Preference Stock or an increase in the authorized number of

        shares of Serial Preference Stock.

 

          (d) Neither the consent of, nor any adjustment of the voting rights

     of, holders of shares of Serial Preference Stock shall be required for an

     increase in the number of shares of Common Stock authorized or issued or

     for stock splits of the Common Stock or for stock dividends on any class of

     stock payable solely in Common Stock, and none of the foregoing actions

     shall be deemed to affect adversely the voting powers, rights or

     preferences of Serial Preference Stock within the meaning and for the

     purpose of this Division B.

     pre-emptive right to purchase or have offered to them for purchase any

     shares or other securities of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter

     authorized.

 

          SECTION 8.  For the purposes of this Division B:

 

          Whenever reference is made to shares "ranking prior to the Serial

     Preference Stock", such reference shall mean and include all shares of the

     Corporation in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof as to the

     payment of dividends or as to distributions in the event of an involuntary

     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are given

     preference over the rights of the holders of Serial Preference Stock;

     whenever reference is made to shares "on a parity with the Serial

     Preference Stock", such reference shall mean and include all shares of

     Serial Preference Stock II and all other shares of the Corporation in

     respect of which the rights of the holders thereof as to the payment of

     dividends and as to distributions in the event of an involuntary

     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation rank on an

     equality (except as to the amounts fixed therefor) with the rights of the

     holders of Serial Preference Stock; and whenever reference is made to

     shares "ranking junior to the Serial Preference Stock" such reference shall

     mean and include all shares of the Corporation in respect of which the

     rights of the holders as to the payment of dividends and as to

     distributions in the event of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or

     winding up of the Corporation are junior and subordinate to the rights of

     the holders of the Serial Preference Stock.

          The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt from time to time

     amendments to the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation fixing and

     entitled to receive out of any funds legally available for Serial

     Preference Stock II and Serial Preference Stock and when and as declared by

     the Board of Directors dividends in cash at the rate for such series fixed

     in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division and no

     more, payable quarterly on the dates fixed for such series. Such dividends

     shall be cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from

     and after the date of issuance thereof or from and after such other date or

     dates as may be fixed and determined by the Board of Directors by amendment

     to the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation as provided in Section

     1 of this Division. No dividends may be paid upon or declared or set apart

     for any of the Serial Preference Stock II for any quarterly dividend period

     unless at the same time (i) a like proportionate dividend for the same

     quarterly dividend period, ratably in proportion to the respective annual

     dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be paid upon or declared or set apart

     for all Serial Preference Stock II of all series then issued and

     outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend and (ii) the dividend

     payable during the same quarterly dividend period upon all Serial

     Preference Stock of all series then issued and outstanding at the rate and

     upon the date as fixed and determined by the Board of Directors as provided

     dividend.

 

          SECTION 3.  In no event so long as any Serial Preference Stock II

     shall be outstanding shall any dividends, except a dividend payable in

     Common Stock or other shares ranking junior to the Serial Preference Stock

     II, be paid or declared or any distribution be made except as aforesaid on

     the Common Stock or any other shares ranking junior to the Serial

     Preference Stock II, nor shall any Common Stock or any other shares ranking

     junior to the Serial Preference Stock II be purchased, retired or otherwise

     acquired by the Corporation (except out of the proceeds of the sale of

     Common Stock or other shares ranking junior to the Serial Preference Stock

     II received by the Corporation subsequent to January 1, 1964):

 

             (a) unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on Serial Preference

        Stock II, including the full dividends for the current quarterly

        dividend period, shall have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient

        for payment thereof set apart; and

 

                                        7

             (b) unless there shall be no arrearages with respect to the

        redemption of Serial Preference Stock II of any series from any sinking

        fund provided for shares of such series in accordance with the

        provisions of Section 1 of this Division.

 

          SECTION 4.

 

          (a) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation may

     from time to time redeem all or any part of the Serial Preference Stock II

     of any series at the time outstanding (i) at the option of the Board of

     Directors at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in

     accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division, or (ii) in

     fulfillment of the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of

     such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in

     accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Division, together in

     each case with accrued dividends to the redemption date.

 

          (b) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid,

     to the holders of record of the Serial Preference Stock II to be redeemed

     at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the

     Corporation, and shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general

     circulation in the City of New York, New York, not less than thirty (30)

     days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for such

     redemption. At any time before or after notice has been given as above

     provided, the Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of the

     shares of Serial Preference Stock II to be redeemed with any bank or trust

     company in the City of Cleveland, Ohio, or the City of New York, New York,

     having capital and surplus of more than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000),

     named in such notice, directed to be paid to the respective holders of the

     shares of Serial Preference Stock II so to be redeemed, in amounts equal to

     the redemption price of all shares of Serial Preference Stock II so to be

     redeemed, on surrender of the stock certificate or certificates held by

     such holders, and upon the making of such deposit such holders shall cease

     to be shareholders with respect to such shares, and after such notice shall

     have been given and such deposit shall have been made, such holders shall

     have no interest in or claim against the Corporation with respect to such

     shares and shall be entitled only to receive such moneys from such bank or

     trust company without interest. In case less than all of the outstanding

     shares of Serial Preference Stock II are to be redeemed, the Corporation

     shall select by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be

     prescribed by its Board of Directors.

 

          If the holders of shares of Serial Preference Stock II which shall

     have been called for redemption shall not, within six years after such

     deposit, claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such

     bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such

     unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the

     Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and

     to such holders.

 

          (c) Any shares of Serial Preference Stock II which are redeemed by the

     Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4 and any shares of

     Serial Preference Stock II which are purchased and delivered in

     satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of such

     series and any shares of Serial Preference Stock II which are converted in

     accordance with the express terms thereof shall be cancelled and not

     reissued. Any shares of Serial Preference Stock II otherwise acquired by

     the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized and unissued shares

     of Serial Preference Stock II without serial designation.

 

          SECTION 5.

 

          (a) The holders of the Serial Preference Stock II of any series shall,

     in case of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the

     Corporation, be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the

     Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or

     distributed among the holders of the Common Stock or any other shares

     ranking junior to the Serial Preference Stock II, the amounts fixed with

     respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this

     Division, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon

     to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation,

     dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In case the

     net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient

     to permit the payment upon all outstanding shares of Serial Preference

     Stock and Serial Preference Stock II of the full preferential amount to

     which they

 

                                        8

<PAGE>   10

 

     are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed

     ratably to all outstanding shares of Serial Preference Stock and Serial

     Preference Stock II in proportion to the full preferential amount to which

     each such share is entitled.

 

          After payment to holders of Serial Preference Stock II of the full

     preferential amounts as aforesaid, holders of Serial Preference Stock II,

     as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the

     Corporation.

 

          (b) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any

     other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the

     sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property of the

     Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or

     winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this Section 5.

 

          SECTION 6.

 

          (a) The holders of Serial Preference Stock II shall be entitled at all

     times to one vote for each share, and, except as otherwise provided herein

     or required by law, the holders of the Serial Preference Stock II, the

     holders of Serial Preference Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall

     vote together as one class on all matters, subject, however, to the special

     voting rights conferred upon the holders of Serial Preference Stock as

     hereinabove provided in Section 6 of Division B hereof.

 

          If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in the

     payment of the equivalent of six (6) full quarterly dividends on all shares

     of all series of Serial Preference Stock II at the time outstanding,

     whether or not earned or declared, the holders of Serial Preference Stock

     II of all series, voting separately as a class and in addition to all other

     rights to vote for Directors, shall be entitled to elect, as herein

     provided, three (3) members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation;

     provided, however, that the holders of shares of Serial Preference Stock II

     shall not have or exercise such special class voting rights except at

     meetings of the shareholders for the election of Directors at which the

     holders of not less than thirty-five per cent (35%) of the outstanding

     shares of Serial Preference Stock II of all series then outstanding are

     present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class

     voting rights provided for herein when the same shall have become vested

     shall remain so vested until all accrued unpaid dividends on the Serial

     Preference Stock II of all series then outstanding shall have been paid,

     whereupon the holders of the Serial Preference Stock II shall be divested

     of their special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of

     Directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in

     the event hereinabove specified in this Section.

 

          In the event of default entitling the holders of Serial Preference

     Stock II to elect three (3) Directors as above specified, a special meeting

     of the shareholders for the purpose of electing such Directors shall be

     called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may

     be called by, the holders of record of at least ten per cent (10%) of the

     shares of Serial Preference Stock II of all series at the time outstanding,

     and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for

     the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation

     shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of

     shareholders shall be held within ninety (90) days after the date of

     receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Serial

     Preference Stock II. At any meeting at which the holders of the Serial

     Preference Stock II shall be entitled to elect Directors, the holders of

     thirty-five per cent (35%) of the then outstanding shares of Serial

     Preference Stock II of all series, present in person or by proxy, shall be

     sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a

     majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall

     be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of

     Directors which the holders of the Serial Preference Stock II are entitled

     to elect as hereinabove provided.

          (b) The consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the number of

     shares of Serial Preference Stock II at the time outstanding given in

     person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting called for the

     purpose at which the holders of the Serial Preference Stock II shall vote

     separately as a class, shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the

     following (but so far as the holders of Serial Preference Stock II are

     concerned, such action may be effected with such consent):

 

             (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of

        these Articles of Incorporation, as the same may at any time be amended,

        or of the Regulations of the Corporation which affects adversely the

        voting powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Serial Preference

        Stock II or reduces the time for any notice to which the holders of

        Serial Preference Stock II may be entitled; provided, however, that

        neither the amendment of these Articles of Incorporation, as the same

        may at any time be amended, so as to authorize or create, or to increase

        the authorized amount of, Serial Preference Stock II or of any shares of

        any class ranking on a parity with or junior to the Serial Preference

        Stock II, nor the amendment of the provisions of the Regulations so as

        to increase the number of Directors of the Corporation, shall be deemed

        to affect adversely the voting powers, rights or preferences of the

        holders of the Serial Preference Stock II; and provided, further, that

        if such amendment, alteration or repeal affects adversely the rights or

        preferences of one or more but not all series of Serial Preference Stock

        II at the time outstanding, only the consent of the holders of at least

        two-thirds of the number of the shares of the series so affected shall

        be required;

 

             (ii) the authorization or creation of, or the increase in the

        authorized amount of, any shares of any class, or any security

        convertible into shares of any class, ranking prior to the Serial

        Preference Stock II; or

 

             (iii) the purchase or redemption (for sinking fund purposes or

        otherwise) of less than all of the Serial Preference Stock II then

        outstanding except in accordance with a stock purchase offer made to all

        holders of record of Serial Preference Stock II, unless all dividends

        upon all Serial Preference Stock II then outstanding for all previous

        quarterly dividend periods shall have been declared and paid or funds

        therefor set apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable

        thereto shall have been complied with.

 

          (c) The consent of the holders of at least a majority of the number of

     shares of Serial Preference Stock II at the time outstanding, given in

     person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose

     at which the holders of the Serial Preference Stock II shall vote

     separately as a class, shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the

     following (but so far as the holders of Serial Preference Stock II are

     concerned, such action may be effected with such consent):

 

             (i) the sale, lease or conveyance by the Corporation of all or

        substantially all of its property or business or the voluntary parting

        with the control thereof, or its consolidation with or merger into any

        other corporation, unless the corporation resulting from such

        consolidation or merger will have after such consolidation or merger no

        class of shares either authorized or outstanding ranking prior to or on

        a parity with the Serial Preference Stock II except the same number of

        shares ranking prior to or on a parity with the Serial Preference Stock

        II and having the same rights and preferences as the shares of the

        Corporation authorized and outstanding immediately preceding such

        consolidation or merger, and each holder of Serial Preference Stock II

        immediately preceding such consolidation or merger shall receive the

        same number of shares, with the same rights and preferences, of the

        resulting corporation; or

 

             (ii) the authorization of any shares ranking on a parity with the

        Serial Preference Stock II or an increase in the authorized number of

        shares of Serial Preference Stock II.

 

          (d) Neither the consent of, nor any adjustment of the voting rights

     of, holders of shares of Serial Preference Stock II shall be required for

     an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock authorized or issued or

     for stock splits of the Common Stock or for stock dividends on any class of

     stock payable solely in Common Stock, and none of the foregoing actions

     shall be deemed to affect adversely the voting powers, rights or

     preferences of Serial Preference Stock II within the meaning and for the

     purpose of this Division C.

pre-emptive right to purchase or have offered to them for purchase any shares or

other securities of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized.

 

     SECTION 8.  For the purposes of this Division C:

 

     Whenever reference is made to shares "ranking prior to the Serial

Preference Stock II", such reference shall mean and include all shares of the

Corporation in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof as to the

payment of dividends or as to distributions in the event of an involuntary

liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are given preference

over the rights of the holders of Serial Preference Stock II; whenever reference

is made to shares "on a parity with the Serial Preference Stock II", such

reference shall mean and include all shares of Serial Preference Stock and all

other shares of the Corporation in respect of which the rights of the holders

thereof as to the payment of dividends and as to distributions in the event of

an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation rank on

an equality (except as to the amounts fixed therefor) with the rights of the

holders of the Serial Preference Stock II; and whenever reference is made to

shares "ranking junior to the Serial Preference Stock II", such reference shall

mean and include all shares of the Corporation in respect of which the rights of

the holders as to the payment of dividends and as to distributions in the event

of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are

junior and subordinate to the rights of the holders of the Serial Preference

Stock II.

               Express Terms of Cumulative Serial Preference Stock II,

          SECTION 6.  Liquidation Rights. The amount payable on shares of Series

     1 in the event of any voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of

     the affairs of the Corporation prior to March 15, 1974 shall be $112.00 per

     share and thereafter shall be an amount equal to the redemption price for

     shares of Series 1 in effect on the distribution date, and in the event of

     any involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation

     shall be $104.00 per share.

 

        SECTION 7.  Conversion Right.

 

          (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section

     7, shares of Series 1 may, at the option of the holder at any time (or, in

     the case of shares called for redemption, then until and including the

     close of business on the date fixed for redemption but not thereafter if

     payment of the redemption price has been duly provided for by the date

     fixed for redemption), be converted into shares of Common Stock (as such

     shares shall be constituted at the conversion date) at the conversion price

     in effect at the conversion date.

 

          (b) The holder of each share of Series 1 may exercise the conversion

     privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any transfer agent of Series

     1 the share to be converted, accompanied by written notice that the holder

     elects to convert such share. Conversion shall be deemed to have been

     effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date when such

     delivery is made, and such date is referred to in this Section as the

     "conversion date". On the conversion date or as promptly thereafter as

     practicable, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the holder of

     shares of Series 1 surrendered for conversion, or on his written order, a

     certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the

     conversion of such shares of Series 1 and a check or cash in respect of any

     fraction of a share as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 7. The

     person in whose name the stock certificate is to be issued shall be deemed

     to have become a holder of Common Stock of record on the conversion date.

     No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on such shares of Series 1 or

     for dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued on conversion.

 

          (c) The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractional shares

     of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series 1. If more than one

     share of Series 1 shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the

     same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon

     conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number

     of shares so surrendered. If any fractional interest in a share of Common

     Stock would be deliverable upon the conversion of any shares of Series 1,

     the Corporation shall, in lieu of delivering the fractional share therefor,

     make an adjustment therefor in cash at the current market value thereof,

     computed on the basis of the last reported sale price of the shares of

     Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day before

     the conversion date or, if there was no reported sale on that day, on the

     basis of the mean of the closing bid and asked quotations on that Exchange

     on that day, or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on that Exchange,

     on the basis of the mean of the closing bid and asked quotations in the

     over-the-counter market on that day, as reported by the National Quotation

     Bureau, or similar reporting service.

 

          (d) Unless and until an adjusted conversion price of the Common Stock

     is required to be computed as hereinafter provided, the conversion price

     for such Common Stock shall be $90.909 per share (this initial conversion

     price being herein called the "base conversion price"). The number of

     shares of

 

                                       12

<PAGE>   14

 

     Common Stock issuable upon conversion of one share of Series 1 shall be

     determined by dividing $100 by the conversion price then in effect.

 

          (e) The conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time as

     follows:

 

             (A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C), (E) and (F) below,

        whenever the Corporation shall issue or sell any Additional Shares as

        hereinafter defined for a consideration per share less than the

        conversion price then in effect, or without consideration, the

        conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance shall

        forthwith be adjusted as follows:

 

                (1) multiply the base conversion price by the sum of (i) the

           total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (excluding shares

           held in the Corporation's treasury) on November 16, 1967 and (ii) the

           total number of shares of Common Stock issuable on November 16, 1967

           upon conversion of any shares of Serial Preference Stock then

           outstanding (the sum of such shares being herein called the "Base

           Shares"), then

 

                (2) add to the result so obtained the total consideration

           received by the Corporation for all Additional Shares, and then

 

                (3) divide such result by the sum of the number of Base Shares

           and the number of Additional Shares, disregarding in the quotient so

           obtained fractions of one cent;

 

        provided, however, that such adjustment shall be made only if the

        resulting quotient shall be less than the conversion price in effect

        immediately prior to the issue or sale of such Additional Shares.

 

             (B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A) above, the following

        provisions shall be applicable:

 

                (1) The term "Additional Shares" shall mean all shares of Common

           Stock issued by the Corporation (whether or not the consideration

           therefor, if any, is less per share than the base conversion price)

           in excess of the Base Shares, whether or not subsequently reacquired

           or retired by the Corporation, other than:

 

                    (i) shares now or hereafter held in the Corporation's

               treasury;

 

                    (ii) shares issued pursuant to any employees' stock purchase

               plan or any employees' stock option plan heretofore or hereafter

               adopted or approved by the shareholders of the Corporation and

               shares issued pursuant to any employees' stock purchase plan or

               employees' stock option agreement heretofore or hereafter assumed

               by the Corporation, including in the case of any plan or

               agreement covered by this clause (ii) shares of Common Stock

               issued upon the conversion of convertible securities so issued;

 

                    (iii) except as provided in paragraph (4) below, shares of

               Common Stock issued in connection with the acquisition by the

               Corporation of the properties, assets and business of another

               corporation, firm or other entity as a going concern (whether

               such acquisition is by way of a merger, combination or majority

               share acquisition or otherwise) and shares of Common Stock issued

               upon conversion of any convertible securities issued by the

               Corporation in connection with any such acquisition (as used

               herein, the terms

               "combination" and "majority share acquisition" shall have the

               meanings set forth in Section 1701.01 of the Ohio Revised Code);

               and

 

                    (iv) shares issued by way of dividend or other distribution

               on shares of Common Stock excluded from the definition of

               Additional Shares by the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) or

               this clause (iv) or on shares resulting from any subdivision or

               combination of shares so excluded.

 

                (2) In case of the issuance or sale of Additional Shares for

           cash, the consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the amount of

           cash received by the Corporation for such shares (or, if such

           Additional Shares are offered by the Corporation for subscription,

           the subscription price, or, if such Additional Shares are sold to

           underwriters or dealers for public offering without a subscription

           offering, the initial public offering price), without deducting

           therefrom any

 

                                       13

<PAGE>   15

 

           compensation or discount in the sale, underwriting or purchase

           thereof by underwriters or dealers or others performing similar

           services or for any expenses incurred by the Corporation in

           connection therewith.

 

                (3) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) below, in the

           case of issuance or sale of Additional Shares for a consideration

           other than cash, the amount of such consideration shall be deemed to

           be the fair value thereof as determined by the Directors of the

           Corporation, for purposes of this subparagraph (B), irrespective of

           any accounting treatment.

 

                (4) Subject to clause (iii) of this paragraph (4):

 

                    (i) any shares of Common Stock issued in connection with any

               merger of IRC, Inc. into the Corporation shall constitute

               Additional Shares and shall be deemed to have been issued for a

               consideration equal to the conversion price in effect immediately

               prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares;

 

                    (ii) in the case of the issuance of any shares of Preference

               Stock II in connection with any merger of United-Carr

               Incorporated or IRC, Inc. into the Corporation, any shares of

               Common Stock into which such shares of Preference Stock II are

               initially convertible shall constitute Additional Shares and

               shall be deemed to have been issued at the time of the issuance

               of such shares of Preference Stock II for a consideration equal

               to the conversion price of Series 1 in effect immediately prior

               to the issuance of such shares of Preference Stock II; and

 

                    (iii) no shares of Common Stock covered by clauses (i) or

               (ii) of this paragraph (4) in excess of an aggregate of 1,221,569

               shares (proportionately adjusted to reflect any split or

               combination of, or stock dividend paid on, the Common Stock prior

               to the effective dates of said mergers) shall at any time

               constitute Additional Shares.

 

                (5) In the case of issuance of Additional Shares as a stock

           dividend of 15% or less, the shares shall be deemed to have been

           issued without consideration at the close of business on the dividend

           record date.

 

                (6) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) above, in the

           case of the issuance of Additional Shares upon conversion or exchange

           of other securities of the Corporation, the amount of consideration

           received by the Corporation shall be deemed to be the total of (a)

           the amount of consideration, if any, received by the Corporation upon

           the issuance of such other securities, plus (b) the amount of the

           consideration, if any, other than such other securities, received by

           the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange. In determining the

           amount of the consideration received by the Corporation upon the

           issuance of such other securities, the amount of the consideration in

           cash and other than cash shall be determined pursuant to paragraphs

           (2) and (3) above. If securities of the same class or series of a

           class as such other securities were issued for different amounts of

           consideration (determined as above provided), or if some were issued

           for no consideration, then the amount of the consideration received

           by the Corporation upon the issuance of each of the securities of

           such class or series, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the

           average amount of the consideration received by the Corporation upon

           the issuance of all the securities of such class or series, as the

           case may be.

 

             (C) If, at any time after November 16, 1967, the Corporation splits

        or combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then as of the close

        of business on the effective date of such split or combination the

        conversion price shall be proportionately decreased in the case of a

        split or increased in the case of a combination. A stock dividend of

        more than 15% shall be considered a stock split, and the effective date

        shall be deemed to be the close of business on the dividend record date.

 

             (D) Whenever the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided,

        the Corporation shall forthwith place on file with each transfer agent

        of shares of Series 1 a statement signed by the President or a Vice

        President of the Corporation and by its Treasurer or an Assistant

        Treasurer

 

                                       14

<PAGE>   16

 

        showing in detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the conversion

        price after such adjustment and shall exhibit the same from time to time

        to any holder of shares of Series 1 desiring an inspection thereof. The

        Corporation shall also cause a notice, stating that such adjustment has

        been effected and setting forth the adjusted conversion price, to be

        published at least once in a newspaper printed in the English language

        and customarily published at least once a day for at least five days in

        each calendar week, which shall be of general circulation in the Borough

        of Manhattan, the City of New York (herein called an "Authorized

        Newspaper").

 

             (E) In the case of the issuance of Additional Shares upon

        conversion or exchange of other securities of the Corporation as

        provided in paragraph (6) of subparagraph (B) above, the conversion

        price shall be adjusted to reflect the issuance of such Additional

        Shares only on the 15th day of each calendar month to reflect all such

        conversions or exchanges through the preceding calendar month. Upon the

        redemption of any shares of Series 1, the conversion price shall be

        adjusted to reflect the issuance of such Additional Shares as of a date

        not earlier than the close of business on the fifth business day

        preceding the mailing of the notice of redemption.

 

             (F) No adjustment of the conversion price shall be made if the

        amount of such adjustment shall be less than 50c, but in such case any

        adjustment that would otherwise be required then to be made shall be

        carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the

        next subsequent adjustment, which, together with all adjustments so

        carried forward shall amount to not less than 50c. In case the

        Corporation shall at any time split or combine the outstanding shares of

        Common Stock, said amount of 50c (as theretofore decreased or increased)

        shall forthwith be proportionately decreased in the case of a split or

        increased in the case of a combination, so as to appropriately reflect

        the same. For this purpose, a stock dividend of more than 15% shall be

        considered a split of the outstanding shares.

 

          (f) In case of any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of

     Common Stock (except a split or combination, or a change in par value, or a

     change from par value to no par value, or a change from no par value to par

     value), or in case of any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation

     is a party (other than a merger in which the Corporation is the surviving

     corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change of

     the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation except as stated above), or

     in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the property of

     the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, lawful

     provision shall be made as part of the terms of such reclassification,

     change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance that the holder of each

     share of Series 1 then outstanding shall have the right to convert such

     share into the same kind and amount of stock and other securities and

     property as would be receivable upon such reclassification, change,

     consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of

     shares of Common Stock into which such share might have been converted

     immediately prior thereto.

 

          As evidence of the kind and amount of stock or other securities or

     property into which shares of Series 1 shall be convertible after any such

     reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, or as

     to the appropriate adjustments of the conversion price applicable with

     respect thereto, the transfer agents may accept the certificate of any firm

     of independent public accountants (who may be the regular auditors retained

     by the Corporation) with respect thereto, who as to questions of law may

     request and rely upon an opinion of counsel (who may be counsel for the

     Corporation) and in the absence of bad faith upon the part of the transfer

     agents, they may conclusively rely thereon, and shall not be responsible or

     accountable to any holder of shares of Series 1 for any provision in

     conformity therewith, or approved by such firm of independent public

     accountants.

 

          (g) The issue of stock certificates on conversions of shares of Series

     1 shall be without charge to the converting shareholder for any tax in

     respect of the issue thereof. The Corporation shall not, however, be

     required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer

     involved in the issue and delivery of shares in any name other than that of

     the holder of the shares of Series 1 converted, and the Corporation shall

     not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and

     until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to

     the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the

     satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.

          (h) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available,

     free from pre-emptive rights, out of its authorized and unissued stock or

     out of shares held in its treasury, for the purpose of effecting the

     conversion of shares of Series 1 such number of shares of its Common Stock

     as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all

     outstanding shares of Series 1.

 

          (i) In case at any time:

 

             (1) the Corporation shall pay any dividend upon its Common Stock

        payable in shares of its Common Stock and such dividend shall be in

        excess of five per cent (5%); or

 

             (2) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to the holders of

        its Common Stock of rights to subscribe for or purchase any shares of

        any class or of any other rights;

 

     then, in either of said cases, the Corporation shall give written notice,

     by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of shares of

     Series 1 at his address then appearing on the books of the Corporation, of

     the record date or of the date on which the transfer books of the

     Corporation shall close with respect to such action. Such notice shall be

     given at least twenty (20) days prior to the action in question and not

     less than ten (10) days prior to the record date or the date on which the

     Corporation's transfer books are closed with respect thereto.

 

          (j) In case the Corporation shall pay in any quarter-annual period any

     cash dividends upon its Common Stock which in total amount per share will

     exceed by fifty per cent (50%) the total amount per share of the cash

     dividends paid during the last preceding quarter-annual period, it shall

     cause notice thereof to be published at least once in an Authorized

     Newspaper.

          There is hereby established a third series of Serial Preference Stock

     II, to which the following provisions shall be applicable:

 

          SECTION 1.  Designation of Series. The series shall be designated

     "Cumulative Serial Preference Stock II, $4.50 Convertible Series 3" (herein

     called "Series 3").

 

          SECTION 2.  Number of Shares. The number of shares of Series 3 is

     2,120,000, which number from time to time may be increased or decreased

     (but not below the number of shares of the series then outstanding) by the

     Directors.

 

          SECTION 3.  Dividend Rate. The dividend rate for Series 3 is $4.50 per

     share per annum.

 

          SECTION 4.  Dividend Payment Dates; Cumulation Dates. The dates at

     which dividends on Series 3 shall be payable are March 15, June 15,

     September 15 and December 15 of each year, but the first dividend payment

     date on shares of Series 3 shall be the first payment date occurring at

     least 10 days after the date of the initial issue of shares of Series 3.

     Dividends on shares of Series 3 shall be cumulative as follows:

 

             (a) in the case of the initial issue of shares of Series 3

        dividends shall be cumulative from the date of such initial issue;

             (b) in the case of shares of Series 3 issued during the period

        commencing immediately after such initial issuance date and terminating

        immediately after the record date for the first dividend on shares of

        and

 

             (c) in all other cases, dividends shall be cumulative from the

        dividend payment date next preceding the date of issue of such shares

        unless the shares are issued during the period commencing immediately

        after the record date for a dividend on shares of such series and

        terminating at the close of the payment date for such dividend in which

        case dividends shall be cumulative from the latter payment date.

 

          SECTION 5.  Redemption Prices. The shares of Series 3 shall not be

          SECTION 6.  Liquidation Rights. The amount payable on shares of Series

     3 in the event of any voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of

     the affairs of the Corporation prior to January 1, 1976 shall be $105 per

     share and thereafter shall be an amount equal to the redemption price for

     shares of Series 3 in effect on the distribution date, and in the event of

     any involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation

     shall be $40 per share.

 

        SECTION 7.  Conversion Right.

 

          (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section

     7, shares of Series 3 may, at the option of the holder at any time (or, in

     the case of shares called for redemption, then until and including the

     close of business on the date fixed for redemption but not thereafter if

     payment of the redemption price has been duly provided for by the date

     fixed for redemption), be converted into fully paid and non-assessable

     shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock at

     the rate of 1.862 shares of Common Stock for each share of Series 3.

 

          (b) The holder of each share of Series 3 may exercise the conversion

     privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any transfer agent of Series

     3 the share to be converted accompanied by written notice that the holder

     elects to convert such share. Conversion shall be deemed to have been

     effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date when such

     delivery is made, and such date is referred to in this Section 7 as the

     "conversion date". On the conversion date or as promptly thereafter as

     practicable the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the holder of shares

     of Series 3 surrendered for conversion, or on his written order, a

     certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the

     conversion of such shares of Series 3 and a check or cash in respect of any

     fraction of a share as provided in subparagraph (E) of this Section 7. The

     person in whose name the stock certificate is to be issued shall be deemed

     to have become a holder of Common Stock of record on the conversion date.

     No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on such shares of Series 3 or

     for dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued on conversion.

          (c) The number of shares of Common Stock and the number of shares of

     other classes of stock of the Corporation, if any, into which each share of

     Series 3 is convertible shall be subject to adjustment from time to time

     only as follows:

 

             (A) In case the Corporation shall at any time or times after June

        10, 1968 (1) take a record of the holders of Common Stock for the

        purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend declared payable in

        shares of Common Stock and thereafter pay such dividend, (2) subdivide

        or split the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (3) combine the

        outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or

        (4) issue by reclassification of Common Stock any shares of the

        Corporation, each holder of a share of Series 3 shall thereafter be

        entitled upon the conversion of each share thereof held by him to

        receive for each such share the number of shares of the Corporation

        which he would have owned or have been entitled to receive in respect

        thereof after the happening of the event or events described above which

        shall have happened had such share of Series 3 been converted prior to

        the happening of such event or events, the adjustment to become

        effective immediately at the opening of business on the day next

        following (x) the record date for purposes of clause (1), or (y) the day

        upon which such subdivision, split, combination or reclassification

        shall become effective for purposes of clauses (2), (3) and (4).

 

             (B) In case the Corporation shall at any time or times after June

        10, 1968 take a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of

        entitling them to receive a distribution of evidences of indebtedness or

        stock or other securities or assets (excluding cash dividends payable

        out of consolidated earnings or consolidated earned surplus and

        distributions of the types specified in clauses (1), (2) and (4) of

        subparagraph (A) of this Section 7) or rights or warrants to subscribe

        thereto (excluding those referred to in subparagraph (C) of this Section

        7), the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series

        3 shall thereafter be convertible shall be adjusted by multiplying the

        number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series 3 was

        theretofore convertible by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be

        the current market price per share of Common Stock (as defined in

        subparagraph (D) of this Section 7) at such record date and of which the

        denominator shall be such current market price per share of Common Stock

        less the fair market value (as determined by the Directors, whose

        determination shall be conclusive) of that portion of such evidences of

        indebtedness or stock or other securities or assets so distributed or of

        such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common

        Stock. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such distribution is made

        or such rights or warrants are issued, as the case may be, and upon such

        distribution or issuance shall become effective immediately after the

        record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive

        such distribution or rights or warrants. For purposes of this

        subparagraph (B), consolidated earnings or consolidated earned surplus

        shall be computed by adding thereto all charges against consolidated

        earned surplus on account of dividends paid in shares of Common Stock in

        respect of which an adjustment has been made pursuant to subparagraph

        (A) of this Section 7, all as determined by the independent public

        accountants then regularly auditing the accounts of the Corporation,

        whose determination shall be conclusive.

 

             (C) In case the Corporation shall at any time after June 10, 1968

        issue rights or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling them

        (for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for

        determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or

        warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price

        per share less than the current market price per share of Common Stock

        (as defined in subparagraph (D) of this Section 7) at such record date,

        the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series 3

        shall thereafter be convertible shall be determined by multiplying the

        number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series 3 were

        theretofore convertible by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be

        the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance

        of such rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of

        Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase and of which the

        denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on

        the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of

        shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total

        number of shares so offered would purchase at such current market price.

        Such adjustment shall be made whenever such rights or warrants are

        issued and upon such issuance shall

 

                                       18

<PAGE>   20

 

        become effective immediately after the record date for the determination

        of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants.

 

             (D) For the purpose of any computation under subparagraph (B) or

        (C) of this Section 7, the current market price per share of Common

        Stock at any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing

        prices for the thirty consecutive business days commencing forty-five

        business days before the day in question. The closing price for each day

        shall be the last reported sales price regular way on the relevant

        securities exchange or, if there is no reported sale on such day, the

        mean of the reported closing bid and asked quotations on the relevant

        securities exchange on the day, or, with respect to any such day when

        the Common Stock is not listed on any national securities exchange, the

        mean of the closing bid and asked quotations in the over-the-counter

        market on such day as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or

        similar reporting service. For purposes of this subparagraph (D) and

        subparagraph (E) of this Section 7, "relevant securities exchange" shall

        mean the New York Stock Exchange unless the Common Stock is not then

        listed thereon, in which event it shall mean the principal national

        securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed or

        admitted to trading as determined by the Corporation, which

        determination shall be conclusive.

 

             (E) The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractional

        shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series 3. If more

        than one share of Series 3 shall be surrendered for conversion at one

        time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock

        issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the

        aggregate number of shares so surrendered. If any fractional interest in

        a share of Common Stock would be deliverable upon the conversion of any

        shares of Series 3, the Corporation shall in lieu of delivering the

        fractional share therefor make an adjustment therefor in cash at the

        market value thereof. For such purpose, the market value of a share of

        Common Stock shall be the last reported sale price regular way on the

        relevant securities exchange on the last business day prior to the

        conversion date when the relevant securities exchange is open, or, if

        there is no reported sale on such day, the mean of the reported closing

        bid and asked quotations on the relevant securities exchange on that

        day, or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on any national

        securities exchange, the mean of the closing bid and asked quotations in

        the over-the-counter market on that day as reported by the National

        Quotation Bureau or similar reporting service. This subparagraph (E)

        shall not apply for purposes of making adjustments under subparagraphs

        (A), (B) and (C) of this Section 7.

 

             (F) No adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock into

        which each share of Series 3 is convertible shall be required unless

        such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least

        1/1000th of a share in the number of shares of Common Stock into which

        such share is then convertible; provided, however, that any adjustments

        which by reason of this subparagraph (F) are not required to be made

        shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent

        adjustment.

 

             (G) Whenever any adjustment is required in the shares into which

        each share of Series 3 is convertible, the Corporation shall forthwith

        keep available at each of its transfer agencies at which Series 3 is

        convertible a statement describing in reasonable detail the adjustment

        and the method of calculation used. The Corporation shall also cause a

        notice, stating that such adjustment has been effected and setting forth

        the adjusted conversion price, to be published at least once in a

        newspaper printed in the English language and customarily published at

        least once a day for at least five days in each calendar week which

        shall be of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of

        New York (herein called an "Authorized Newspaper").

 

             (H) As evidence of the kind and amount of stock or other

        securities, cash or property into which shares of Series 3 shall be

        convertible, or as to the appropriate adjustments of the conversion rate

        applicable with respect thereto, each transfer agent of Series 3 may

        accept the certificate of any firm of independent public accountants

        (who may be the regular auditors retained by the Corporation) with

        respect thereto, who as to questions of law may request and rely upon an

        opinion of counsel (who may be counsel for the Corporation) and in the

        absence of bad faith upon the part

 

                                       19

<PAGE>   21

 

        of the transfer agent, it may conclusively rely thereon, and shall not

        be responsible or accountable to any holder of shares of Series 3 for

        any provision in conformity therewith, or approved by such firm of

        independent public accountants.

 

          (d) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out

     of the authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock the full number of

     shares of Common Stock into which all shares of Series 3 from time to time

     outstanding are convertible, but shares of Common Stock held in the

     treasury of the Corporation may in its discretion be delivered upon any

     conversion of shares of Series 3.

 

          (e) The issue of stock certificates on conversions of shares of Series

     3 shall be without charge to the converting shareholder for any tax in

     respect of the issue thereof. The Corporation shall not, however, be

     required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer

     involved in the issue and delivery of shares in any name other than that of

     the holder of the shares of Series 3 converted, and the Corporation shall

     not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and

     until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to

     the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the

     satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.

 

          (f) In case the total amount of cash dividends paid by the Corporation

     in any quarter-annual period on the number of shares of Common Stock into

     which each share of Series 3 shall be convertible at the time of such

     payment exceeds $1.125, it shall cause notice thereof to be published at

     least once in an Authorized Newspaper.

 

                                  DIVISION C-4

                          Express Terms of Cumulative

                Redeemable Serial Preference Stock II, Series 4

 

     There is hereby established a fourth series of Serial Preference Stock II

to which the following provisions shall be applicable:

 

          SECTION 1. Designation of Series.  The series shall be designated

     "Cumulative Redeemable Serial Preference Stock II, Series 4" (herein called

     "Series 4").

 

          SECTION 2. Number of Shares.  The number of shares of Series 4 is

     1,145,000, which number from time to time may be increased or decreased

     (but not below the number of shares of the series then outstanding) by the

     Directors.

 

          SECTION 3. Dividends.

 

          (a) The holders of record of shares of Series 4 shall be entitled to

     receive, when and as declared by the Directors in accordance with the terms

     hereof, out of funds legally available for the purpose, cumulative

     quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of January, April,

     July and October in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a

     "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly

     Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of any shares of Series 4 or

     any fraction of a share of Series 4, in an amount per share (rounded to the

     nearest cent) equal to the lesser of (i) $100.00 and (ii) subject to the

     provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per

     share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share

     amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions

     (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or a subdivision

     of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, by reclassification or

     otherwise), declared on the shares of Common Stock since the immediately

     preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first

     Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any shares of

     Series 4 or any fraction of a share of Series 4. In the event the

     Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common

     Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or

     combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

     reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of

     Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock,

     then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series 4

     were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the

     preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a

     fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of

 

                                       20

<PAGE>   22

 

     Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator

     of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding

     immediately prior to such event.

 

          (b) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding

     shares of Series 4 from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding

     the date of issue of such shares of Series 4, unless the date of issue of

     such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend

     Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue

     from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a

     Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the

     determination of holders of shares of Series 4 entitled to receive a

     quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in

     either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be

     cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid

     dividends shall not bear interest. No dividends shall be paid upon or

     declared and set apart for any shares of Series 4 for any dividend period

     unless at the same time a dividend for the same dividend period, ratably in

     proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be

     paid upon or declared and set apart for all Serial Preference Stock II of

     all series then outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend. The

     Directors of the Corporation may fix a record date for the determination of

     holders of shares of Series 4 entitled to receive payment of a dividend or

     distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 40

     days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

 

          SECTION 4. Redemption Rights.  Subject to the provisions of Section

     6(b)(iii) of Division C of Article Fourth hereof and in accordance with the

     provisions of Section 4 of Division C of Article Fourth hereof, the shares

     of Series 4 shall be redeemable from time to time at the option of the

     Directors of the Corporation, as a whole or in part, at any time, at a

     redemption price per share equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase

     Price as defined in that certain rights agreement, dated as of April 24,

     1996 between the Corporation and its rights agent (the "Rights Agreement"),

     as the same may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms,

     subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the Rights

     Agreement. Copies of the Rights Agreement are available from the

     Corporation upon request. In the event less than all of the outstanding

     shares of Series 4 are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot

     the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the

     Directors of the Corporation.

 

          SECTION 5. Liquidation Rights.

 

          (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,

     dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation (hereinafter

     referred to as a "Liquidation"), no distribution shall be made to the

     holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon

     Liquidation) to the shares of Series 4, unless, prior thereto, the holders

     of shares of Series 4 shall have received at least an amount per share

     equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase Price as defined in the

     Rights Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time in

     accordance with its terms, subject to adjustment from time to time as

     provided in the Rights Agreement, plus an amount equal to accrued and

     unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not earned or

     declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares

     of Series 4 shall be entitled to receive at least an aggregate amount per

     share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal

     to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of

     shares of Common Stock (the "Series 4 Liquidation Preference").

 

          (b) In the event, however, that the net assets of the Corporation are

     not sufficient to pay in full the amount of the Series 4 Liquidation

     Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Serial

     Preference Stock II, if any, which rank on a parity with the shares of

     Series 4 as to distribution of assets in Liquidation, all shares of Series

     4 and of such other series of Serial Preference Stock II shall share

     ratably in the distribution of assets (or proceeds thereof) in Liquidation

     in proportion to the full amounts to which they are respectively entitled.

 

          (c) In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any

     dividend on the shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock,

     or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding

     shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of

     a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of

     shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders

     of shares of Series 4 were entitled

 

                                       21

<PAGE>   23

 

     immediately prior to such event pursuant to the proviso set forth in

     paragraph (a) above, shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a

     fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock

     outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is

     the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately

     prior to such event.

 

          (d) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any

     other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the

     sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or

     business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation for

     the purposes of this Section 5.

 

          SECTION 6. Conversion Right.  The shares of Series 4 shall not be

     convertible into shares of Common Stock.

 

                                   DIVISION D

                         Express Terms of Common Stock

 

          The Common Stock shall be subject to the express terms of the Serial

     Preference Stock and any series thereof and to the express terms of the

     Serial Preference Stock II and any series thereof. Each share of Common

     Stock shall be equal to every other share of Common Stock; and the holders

     thereof shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock on all

     questions presented to the shareholders.

 

          The holders of shares of Common Stock shall have no pre-emptive right

     to purchase or have offered to them for purchase any shares of Common Stock

     or other securities of the Corporation whether now or hereafter authorized.

 

     Fifth: The Corporation may from time to time, pursuant to authorization by

its Board of Directors and without action by the shareholders, purchase or

otherwise acquire shares of the Corporation of any class; subject, however, to

such limitation or restriction, if any, as is contained in the express terms of

any class of shares of the Corporation outstanding at the time of such purchase

or acquisition.

 

     Sixth: Any and every statute of Ohio hereafter enacted whereby the rights,

powers or privileges of corporations or of the shareholders of corporations

organized under the laws of Ohio are increased or diminished or in any way

affected, or whereby effect is given to the action taken by any number, less

than all, of the shareholders of any such corporation, shall apply to the

Corporation and shall be binding not only upon the Corporation but upon every

shareholder of the Corporation to the same extent as if such statute had been in

force on October 31, 1958, the time of merger of The Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation

into the Corporation.

 

     Seventh: These Amended Articles of Incorporation shall supersede and take

the place of the heretofore existing Articles of Incorporation of the

Corporation and all amendments thereto.

 

                                       22
