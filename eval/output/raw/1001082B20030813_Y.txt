hereby authorized to provide, by resolution or resolutions adopted by such

         stock of the Corporation in such amount as is set forth in the Board

         resolutions establishing such class or series or as is determined in a

         manner specified in such resolutions;

<PAGE>



         resolutions establishing such class or series or as are determined in a

         manner specified in such resolutions;



                  (8) are entitled to such voting rights, if any, as are

         specified in the Board resolutions establishing such class or series

         (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the right

         to elect one or more directors voting alone as a single class or series

         or together with one or more other classes and/or series of Preferred

         Stock, if so specified by such Board resolutions) at all times or upon

         the occurrence of specified events; and



                  (9) are subject to restrictions on the issuance of additional

         shares of Preferred Stock of such class or series or of any other class

         or series, or on the reissuance of shares of Preferred Stock of such

         class or series or of any other class or series, or on increases or

         decreases in the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock of such

         class or series or of any other class or series.



Without limiting the generality of the foregoing authorizations, any of the

voting powers, designations, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations

or restrictions of a class or series of Preferred Stock may be made dependent

upon facts ascertainable outside the Board resolutions establishing such class

or series, all to the full extent permitted by the Nevada General Corporation

Law. Unless otherwise specified in the Board resolutions establishing a class or

series of Preferred Stock, holders of a class or series of Preferred Stock shall

not be entitled to cumulate their votes in any election of directors in which

they are entitled to vote and shall not be entitled to any preemptive rights to

acquire shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation.



                                    ARTICLE V

                          Voting and Conversion Rights



         1.       Voting Rights.



                  (a) Except as otherwise required by law or, in any Preferred

Stock Statement and Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights

("Certificate of Designations"), with respect to all matters upon which

stockholders are entitled to vote or to which stockholders are entitled to give

consent, the holders of any outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B

Common Stock, Class C Common Stock and Preferred Stock shall vote together

without regard to class, and every holder of any outstanding shares of the Class

A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock held by such holder; every holder of any

outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to cast ten votes

in person or by proxy for each share of Class B Common Stock held by such

holder; and every holder of any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be

entitled to cast, in person or by proxy for each share of Preferred Stock held

by such holder, the number of votes specified in the applicable Certificate of

Designations; provided however, in the event of a "Change in Control" of the

Corporation, the holders



<PAGE>



of any outstanding shares of Class C Common Stock shall be entitled to cast ten

votes in person or by proxy for each share of Class C Common Stock held by such

holder. As used herein, a "Change of Control" of the Corporation means: (i) any

transaction or series of transactions, the result of which is that the

Principals and their Related Parties (as such terms are hereinafter defined), or

an entity controlled by the Principals and their Related Parties, cease to be

the "beneficial owners" (as defined in Rule 13(d) (3) under the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934) of at least 30% of the total equity interests of the

Corporation and to have the voting power to elect at least a majority of the

Board of Directors of the Corporation; or (ii) the first day on which a majority

of the members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation are not continuing

directors. "Principals" means Charles W. Ergen, James DeFranco, and David K.

Moskowitz. "Related Parties" means, with respect to any Principal: (y) the

spouse and each immediate family member of such Principal; and (z) each trust,

corporation, partnership or other entity of which such Principal beneficially

holds an 80% or more controlling interest.



                  (b) A quorum for the purpose of shareholder meeting shall

consist of a majority of the voting power of EchoStar. If a quorum is present,

the effective vote of a majority of the voting power represented at the meeting

and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders,

unless the vote of a greater proportion or number is required by any provisions

contained in the NGCL. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in the NGCL

requiring the vote of shares possessing two-thirds of the voting power of

EchoStar to take action, absent a provision herein to the contrary, in the case

of such provisions the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power shall

be the act of the shareholders.



                  (c) Holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to cumulate

their votes in the election of directors and shall not be entitled to any

preemptive rights to acquire shares of any class or series of capital stock of

the Corporation. Subject to any preferential rights of holders of Preferred

Stock, holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive their pro rata

shares, based upon the number of shares of Common Stock held by them, of such

dividends or other distributions as may be declared by the Board of Directors

from time to time and of any distribution of the assets of the Corporation upon

its liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary.



         2.       Conversion Rights.



                  (a) Each share of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common

Stock Shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof into Class A

Common Stock of the Corporation in accordance with this Article V. In order to

exercise the conversion privilege, a holder of Class B Common Stock or Class C

Common Stock shall surrender the certificate evidencing such Class B Common

Stock or Class C Common Stock to the Corporation at its principal office, duly

endorsed to the Corporation and accompanied by written notice to the Corporation

that the holder thereof elects to convert a specified portion or all of such

shares. Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock



<PAGE>



converted at the option of the holder shall be deemed to have been converted on

the day of surrender of the certificate representing such shares for conversion

in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the

holder of such Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as such holder,

shall cease and such holder shall be treated for all purposes as the record

holder of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion. As promptly as

practicable on or after the conversion date, the Corporation shall issue and

mail or deliver to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of

Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion, computed to the nearest one

hundredth of a full share, and a certificate or certificates for the balance of

Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock surrendered, if any, not so

converted into Class A Common Stock.



                  (b) The Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock shall be

convertible into one share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B

Common Stock or Class C Common Stock so converted (the "Conversion Rate"). In

the event the Corporation shall at any time subdivide or split its outstanding

Class A Common Stock, into a greater number of shares or declare any dividend

payable in Class A Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior

to such subdivision, split or dividend shall be proportionately increased, and

conversely, in case the outstanding Class A Common Stock of the Corporation

shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Rate in effect

immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately decreased.



                  (c) Upon any adjustment of the Conversion Rate then and in

each such case the Corporation shall give written notice thereof, by first-class

mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the registered holders of Class B Common

Stock and Class C Common Stock at the addresses of such holders as shown on the

books of the Corporation, which notice shall state the Conversion Rate resulting

from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of

shares receivable at such price upon the conversion of Class B Common Stock or

Class C Common Stock, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of

calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based.



                  (d) The holders of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common

Stock shall have the following rights to certain properties received by the

holders of Class A Common Stock:



                           (i) In case the Corporation shall declare a dividend

         or distribution upon Class A Common Stock payable other than in cash

         out of earnings or surplus or other than in Class A Common Stock, then

         thereafter each holder of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock

         upon the conversion thereof will be entitled to receive the number of

         shares of Class A Common Stock into which such Class B Common Stock or

         Class C Common Stock shall be converted, and, in addition and without

         payment therefor, the property which such holder would have received as

         a dividend if continuously since the record date for any such dividend

         or distribution such holder: (A) had been the record holder of the

         number of Class A



<PAGE>



         Common Stock then received; and (B) had retained all dividends or

         distributions originating directly or indirectly from such Class A

         Common Stock.



                           (ii) If any capital reorganization or

         reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation, or

         consolidation or merger of the Corporation with another corporation, or

         the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to another

         corporation shall be effected in such a way that holders of Class A

         Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or assets

         with respect to or in exchange for a Class A Common, then, as a

         condition of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,

         merger or sale, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the

         holders of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock shall

         thereafter have the right to receive, in lieu of Class A Common Stock

         of the Corporation immediately theretofore receivable upon the

         conversion of such Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock, such

         shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with

         respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding Class A Common

         Stock equal to the number of Class A Common Stock immediately

         theretofore receivable upon the conversion or such Class B Common Stock

         and Class C Common Stock had such reorganization, reclassification,

         consolidation, merger or sale not taken place, and in any such case

         appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and

         interests of the holders of the Class B Common Stock and Class C Common

         Stock to the end that the provisions hereof (including without

         limitation provisions for adjustments of the Conversion Rate and of the

         number of shares receivable upon the conversion of such Class B Common

         Stock and Class C Common Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as

         nearly as may be, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or

         assets thereafter receivable upon the conversion of such Class B Common

         Stock and Class C Common Stock. The Corporation shall not effect any

         such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale,

         unless prior to the consummation thereof the surviving corporation (if

         other than the Corporation), the corporation resulting from such

         consolidation or the corporation purchasing such assets shall assume by

         written instrument executed and mailed to the registered holders of the

         Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock at the last address of

         such holders appearing on the books of the Corporation, the obligation

         to deliver to such holders such shares of stock, securities or assets

         as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holders may be

         entitled to receive.



                  (e) In case at any time:



                           (iii) the Corporation shall pay any dividend payable

         in stock upon Class A Common Stock or make any distribution (other than

         regular cash dividends to the holders of Class A Common Stock); or



                           (iv) the Corporation shall offer for subscription pro

         rata to the holders of Class A Common Stock any additional shares of

         stock of any class or other rights; or



<PAGE>



                           (v) there shall be any capital reorganization,

         reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation, or

         consolidation or merger of the Corporation with, or sale of all or

         substantially all of its assets, to another corporation (provided

         however, that this provision shall not be applicable to the merger or

         consolidation of the Corporation with or into another corporation if,

         following such merger or consolidation, the shareholders of the

         Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation own at

         least 80% of the equity of the combined entity); or



                           (vi) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary

         dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation;



then, in any one or more of the aforesaid cases, the Corporation shall give

written notice, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders

of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock at the addresses of such

holders as shown on the books of the Corporation, of the date on which: (A) the

books of the Corporation shall close or a record shall be taken for such

dividend, distribution or subscription rights; or (B) such reorganization,

reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or

winding up shall take place, as the case may be. Such notice shall also specify

the date as of which the holders of Class A Common Stock of record shall

participate in such dividend, distribution, or subscription rights, or shall be

entitled to exchange their Class A Common Stock for securities or other property

deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,

sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, as the case may be. Such written

notice shall be given at least 20 days prior to the action in question and not

less than 20 days prior to the record date or the date on which the

Corporation's transfer books are closed in respect thereto.



                                   ARTICLE VI

                               Board of Directors

         The number of directors shall be increased or decreased as prescribed

by the Bylaws of the Corporation.



                                   ARTICLE VII

                 Right of Directors to Contract with Corporation



         The following provisions are inserted for the management of the

business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and the same are

in furtherance of and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law.



         1.       No contract or other transaction between this Corporation and

one or more of its directors or any other corporation, firm, association, or

entity in which one or more of its directors are directors or officers or are

financially interested shall be either void or voidable solely because of such

relationship or interest or solely because such directors are present at the

meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes,

approves or ratifies such contract or transaction or solely because their votes

are counted for such purpose if:



                           (a) The material facts as to such relationship or

                  interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed

                  or are otherwise known to the Board of Directors or committee

                  and the Board or committee authorizes, approves, or ratifies

                  such contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a

                  majority of the disinterested directors, even though such

                  directors are less than a quorum; or



                           (b) The material facts of such relationship or

                  interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed

                  or are otherwise known to the shareholders entitled to vote

                  thereon and they authorize, approve or ratify such contract or

                  transaction by vote or written consent; or



                           (c) The contract or transaction is fair and

                  reasonable to the Corporation.



         2.       Common or interested directors may be counted in determining

the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee

thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies such contract or transaction.



                                  ARTICLE VIII

                              Corporate Opportunity



         The officers, directors and other members of management of this

Corporation shall be subject to the doctrine of "corporate opportunities" only

insofar as it applies to business opportunities in which this Corporation has

expressed an interest as determined from time to time by this Corporation's

Board of Directors as evidenced by resolutions appearing in



<PAGE>



the Corporation's minutes. Once such areas of interest are delineated, all such

business opportunities within such areas of interest which come to the attention

of the officers, directors and other members of management of this Corporation

shall be offered first to the Corporation. In the event the Corporation declines

to pursue any or all such business opportunities, the officers, directors and

other members of management of this Corporation shall be free to engage in such

areas of interest on their own and this doctrine shall not limit the right of

any officer, director or other member of management of this Corporation to

continue a business existing prior to the time that such area of interest is

designated by the Corporation. This provision shall not be construed to release

any employee of this Corporation (other than an officer, director or member of

management) from any duties which he may have to this Corporation.



                                   ARTICLE IX

                Indemnification of Officers, Directors and Others



         1.       To the full extent permitted by the NGCL, the Corporation

shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a

party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit in proceeding,

whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or

informal (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason

of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent

of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a

director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,

partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,

against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgements, fines an amounts paid

in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such

action, suit or proceeding, if he conducted himself in good faith and in a

manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of

the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no

reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, The termination of any

action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or

upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a

presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he

reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the

Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no

reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.



         2.       The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a

party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or

completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a

judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director,

officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving

at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or

other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and

reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such

of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect

of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged

to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the

Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or

suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication

of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly

and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall

deem proper.



         3.       To the extent that a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or

agent of a corporation has been wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in

defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of

this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be

indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably

incurred by him in connection therewith.



         4.       Any indemnification under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article

IX (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as

authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the

director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent is proper in the circumstances

because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs 1

and 2. Such determination shall be made: (1) by the Board of Directors by a

majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such

action, suit or proceeding; or (2) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if

obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal

counsel in a written opinion; or (3) by the shareholders.



         5.       Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending a

civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation as

they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit

or proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in paragraph 4 of this

Article IX upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director,

officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be

determined by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction that he or she

is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.



         6.       The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain

insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee,

fiduciary or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of

the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other

enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in

any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the

Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under

the provisions of this Article IX.



         7.       In addition to the forgoing, the Corporation shall have the

power to indemnify current or former directors, officer, employees and agents to

the fullest extent provided by law.
