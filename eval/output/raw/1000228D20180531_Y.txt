     A. Preferred Stock:

          1. The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance from time to time of the Preferred Stock in one or more series with such designations and such powers, preferences and rights, and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions (which may differ with respect to each series) as the Board of Directors may fix by resolution. The consent, by class or series vote or otherwise, of the holders of such of the series of Preferred Stock as are from time to time outstanding shall not be required for the issuance by the Board of Directors of any other series of Preferred Stock whether or not the powers, preferences and rights of such other series shall be fixed by the Board of Directors as senior to, or on a parity with, the powers, preferences and rights of such outstanding series, or any of them; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may provide in the resolution or resolutions as to any series of Preferred Stock adopted pursuant to Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH that the consent of the holders of a majority (or such greater proportion as shall be therein fixed) of the outstanding shares of such series voting thereon shall be required for the issuance of any or all other series of Preferred Stock.

          2. Subject to the provisions of Subparagraph 1 of this Paragraph A, shares of any series of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall determine for such consideration as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors.

          3. No dividend shall be declared and set apart for payment on any series of Preferred Stock in respect of any dividend period unless there shall likewise be or have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment, on all shares of Preferred Stock of each other series entitled to cumulative dividends at the time outstanding which rank senior to or equally as to dividends with the series in question, dividends ratably in accordance with the sums which would be payable on the said shares through the end of the last preceding dividend period if all dividends were declared and paid in full.

          4. If, upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation distributable among the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock which (A) are entitled to a preference over the holders of the Common Stock upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding up, and (B) rank equally in connection with any such distribution, shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount to which the

2

          5. Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another corporation nor any sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property, business or assets of the Corporation shall be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Article FOURTH.

          6. In the event that the Preferred Stock of any series shall be redeemable, then, at the option of the Board of Directors, the Corporation may, at such time or times as fixed by a resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors as provided in Subparagraph 1 of this Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH, redeem all, or any number less than all, of the outstanding shares of such series at the redemption price thereof and on the other terms fixed by a resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors as provided in said Subparagraph 1.

          7. Subject to any applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, shares of Preferred Stock that have been issued and reacquired in any manner by the Corporation (excluding, until the Corporation elects to retire them, shares that are held as treasury shares but including shares redeemed and shares purchased and retired, whether through the operation of a retirement or sinking fund, or otherwise) may have the status of authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, and may be reissued as a part of the series of which they were originally a part or be reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors or as part of any other series of Preferred Stock, all subject to the conditions or restrictions on issuance set forth in any resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors as provided in Subparagraph 1 of this Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock.

     B. Common Stock:

          1. After the requirements with respect to preferential dividends on the Preferred Stock (fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH), if any, shall have been met and after the Corporation shall have complied with all the requirements, if any, with respect to the setting aside of sums as sinking funds or redemption or purchase accounts (fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH), and subject further to any other conditions which may be fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH, then and not otherwise the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared thereon from time to time by the Board of Directors in its discretion from any assets legally available for the payment of dividends.

          2. After distribution in full of the preferential amount, if any (fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph A of this Article FOURTH), to be distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock in the event of dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, of the

3



 

Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all the remaining assets of the Corporation, tangible and intangible, of whatever kind available for distribution to stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them respectively.

          3. Each holder of Common Stock shall have one vote in respect of each share of Common Stock held by him or her on all matters voted upon by the stockholders. The affirmative vote of 80% or more of all outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required for the amendment of this subparagraph 3.

     C. Other Provisions:

     EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of Title 8 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

     NINTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by such director as a director, provided that this Article NINTH shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (a) for any breach of such director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions of such director not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (d) for any transaction from which such director derived an improper personal benefit, in respect of which such breach of fiduciary duty occurred; nor shall this Article NINTH eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission occurring prior to the date this Article NINTH becomes effective. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article NINTH to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended from time to time.

     TENTH:

     A. Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, (1) is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or (2) is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense,

7



 

liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Paragraph B hereof the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article TENTH shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his capacity as such (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service with respect to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article TENTH or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

     B. If a claim under Paragraph A of this Article TENTH is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

     C. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article TENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

8



 

     D. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

     ELEVENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, modify or repeal any provisions contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, subject to the express provisions hereof and all rights and powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors, officers or others are granted subject to this reservation.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been signed and attested to on this 2nd day of November, 1995.
