board of supervisory directors at the time the preference shares are issued.

At conversion, the preference share concerned shall acquire all

ISSUES OF SHARES



Article 5.



|  

---|---  

  

1.



|



Shares that have not yet been issued shall, up to the amount of the authorized

capital, with due observance of the provisions of the (Dutch) Civil Code, be

capable of being issued by virtue of a resolution of the board of supervisory

directors. The authority or the board of supervisory directors, as referred to

in the preceding sentence, shall terminate five years after the date of

execution of this deed, unless the general meeting has extended such

authority.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

2.



|



In case the board of supervisory directors no longer has the authority

referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, any resolution to issue shares

shall require the prior approval of the board of supervisory directors.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

3.



|



Any resolution to issue shares shall stipulate the terms and conditions of

PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS.



Article 6.



|

1.

Except as provided below, in the event of the issue of new common shares, each

holder of common shares shall have a pre-emptive right to subscribe to such

shares pro rata to his existing holding of such shares. No pre-emptive rights

are attached to shares issued to employees of the company or employees of a

group company. Shareholders shall furthermore have no pre-emptive right in

respect of shares issued for a non-cash contribution.  

  

The holders of preference shares shall have no pre-emptive rights to subscribe

to shares, whereas holders of common shares shall have no pre-emptive rights

to subscribe to preference shares.



|  

---|---  

  

2.



|



Pre-emptive rights can, with due observance of the relevant provisions of the

(Dutch) Civil Code, be restricted or excluded by virtue of a resolution of the

board of supervisory directors. The provisions in article 5, paragraph 1,

written notification to all the shareholders sent to the addresses set forth

in the register of shareholders within fourteen days of such a resolution

being passed. Pre-emption rights with respect to an issue shall be capable of

being exercised only during the four weeks after the day the announcement

relating to such issue has been sent out.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

4.



|



The provisions in article 5 and in this article shall apply as well to the

granting of rights to subscribe for shares (other than rights granted to

employees of the company or employees of a group company) within the meaning

of Article 2:96A of the (Dutch) Civil Code.  

  

Shareholders, however, shall have no pre-emptive rights for shares which are

being issued to a person who exercises a previously acquired right to

subscribe for shares.



PAYMENT FOR SHARES



Article 7.



|  

---|---  

  

1.



|



The full nominal amount of the shares must be paid in on issue. It may be

stipulated though that a part of the nominal amount of the preference shares,

not exceeding three quarters thereof, needs only be paid after the company has

called it in. If a share is subscribed for at a higher price, the balance of

these amounts must be paid in on issue.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

2.



|



Payment for a share must be made in cash insofar as no other manner of payment

has been agreed on. Payment in foreign currency can be made only with the

approval of the company, which approval shall be deemed given upon acceptance

of foreign currency by the company.  

  

|

company by others.

more than eighteen months. The general meeting must specify in the

authorization the number of shares which may be acquired, the manner in which

they may be acquired and the limits within which the price must be set.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

3.



|



No authorization, as referred to in paragraph 2, shall be required for any

acquisition by the company of its own shares for the purpose of transferring

due observance of the provisions in article 2:99 of the (Dutch) Civil Code.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

2.



|



A resolution to cancel shares may only relate (i) to shares which the company

holds in its own share capital or of which it holds the depositary receipts,

In deviation from the provision in the last sentence of the previous

3.



|



If the usufructuary or pledgee is not such a person, he shall only be entitled

management. In case no binding nomination has been made within the

The board of management shall pass all resolutions adopted at meetings with an

If, however, immediately after a ruling as referred to in the previous

sentence is pronounced, its correctness is disputed, a new vote is taken

provided that this is required by a majority of votes, or if, in the event of

the first vote not being taken by call or not being a written one, one of

those present and entitled to vote should wish so. This new vote nullifies the

legal consequences of the original vote.

|  

---|---

INDEMNIFICATION



Article 17.



|  

---|---  

  

1.



|



Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to

or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason of the

fact that he or she, is or was or has agreed to become a supervisory or

managing director of the company or is or was serving or has agreed to serve

at the request of the company as a supervisory or managing director of another

company or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of

such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a supervisory or

managing director of the company or in any other capacity while serving or

having agreed to serve as a supervisory or managing director, shall be

indemnified by the company against all expense, liability and loss (including

without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or

penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably and

actually incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

2.



|



Such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in

the capacity which initially entitled such person to indemnity hereunder and

shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors of his or her last

will and testament, and the administrators of his estate.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

3.



|



If the damage was caused by seriously culpable conduct (which the parties

intend to be functionally the same as “gross negligence or wilful misconduct”

standards used in New York state law which, while not superseding the Dutch

law governing the relationship between Dutch companies and the directors

thereof, reflects the parties' intent as to the principles which, in the

absence of clear Dutch law to the contrary, should be used for purposes of

this indemnity) on the part of the relevant supervisory director or managing

director, no right to indemnification shall exist.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

4.



|



The right to indemnification shall include the right to be paid by the company

the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final

disposition. The payment of such expenses incurred by a current, former or

proposed supervisory or managing director in his or her capacity as a

supervisory or managing director or proposed supervisory or managing director

in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon

delivery to the company of a written undertaking, by or on behalf of such

person seeking indemnification, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall

ultimately be determined  

  

  



8



* * *



  



  



that such person seeking indemnification is not entitled to be indemnified

under this Article 17 or otherwise.



|  

---|---  

  

5.



|



The managing or supervisory director shall not accept any liability towards

third parties and not enter into a settlement agreement without the prior

written consent of the company. The company and the managing or supervisory

director shall use all reasonable efforts, but at the company's sole expense,

to cooperate in order to agree on the defense against any action against the

managing or supervisory director unless such defense is not, in the opinion of

counsel to the person seeking indemnification, likely to be successful.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

6.



|



If a written claim received by the company from or on behalf of an indemnified

party under this Article 17 is not paid in full by the company within ninety

days after such receipt, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit

against the company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if

successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also

the expense of prosecuting such claim.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

7.



|



The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses

conferred in this Article 17 shall not be exclusive of any other right which

any person may have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory),

provision of the Articles of Association of the company, bylaw, agreement,

vote of stockholders or disinterested supervisory or managing directors or

otherwise.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

8.



|



The company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any

person who is or was serving as a supervisory or managing director of the

company or is or was serving at the request of the company as a supervisory or

managing director of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or

other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans

against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the company would have

the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss

under Dutch law.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

9.



|



If this Article 17 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by

any court of competent jurisdiction, then the company shall nevertheless

indemnify each supervisory or managing director of the company and any person

who is or was serving at the request of the company as a supervisory or

managing director of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or

other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, as

to costs, charges and expenses (including without limitation, attorneys' fees,

judgments, penalties or fines, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)

with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

administrative or investigative to the full extent permitted by any applicable

portion of this Article 17 that shall not have been invalidated and to the

fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

10.



|



For purposes of this Article 17, reference to the “company” shall include, in

addition to the company, any constituent company (including any constituent of

a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger prior to (or, in the case

of an entity specifically designated in a resolution of the board of

supervisory directors, after) the adoption hereof and which, if its separate

existence had continued, would have had the power and authority to indemnify

its supervisory or managing directors of such constituent company and so that

any person who is or was a supervisory or managing director of such

constituent company, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent

company as a supervisory or managing director of another company, partnership,

joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to

employee benefit plans, shall stand in the same position under the provisions

of this Article 17 with respect to the resulting or surviving company as he or

she would have with respect to such constituent company if its separate

existence had continued.  

  

|  

---|---  

  

11.



|



An amendment to this article shall not impair the rights of a person who was a

supervisory director or managing director after the introduction of this

article but before the amendment. The obligations of the company towards such

persons shall remain in effect as if the article had not been amended.

new vote shall be held whenever a majority of the general meeting should wish

so, or, if the original vote was not taken by call or by ballot papers,

whenever any one of the person: entitled to vote should wish so.
