shall be entitled as of right to subscribe for, purchase, or receive any stock

of any class whether now or hereafter authorized, or any bonds, debentures or

other securities whether now or hereafter authorized, convertible into stock

of any class, or any stock into which said bonds, debentures or other

All persons who shall acquire stock in the Corporation shall acquire the same

subject to the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation.



(2) Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in

one or more series, with such distinctive serial designations as may be stated

or expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such

stock adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors; and in such

resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of shares of each particular

series, the Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to fix: the

consideration for which the shares of such series are to be issued; the number

of shares constituting such series; the rate of dividends upon which and the

times at which dividends on shares of such series shall be payable and the

preference, if any, which such dividends shall have relative to dividends on

shares of any other class or classes or any other series of stock of the

(a) Dividends and Distributions.



(i) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of

Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the

Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of

Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock of the

Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive,

when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally

available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first

day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being

referred to herein as a “Quarterly Dividend Payment Date”), commencing on the

first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or

fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share

(rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1 or (b) subject to

the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate

per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share

amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions,

other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of

the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise),

declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A

Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay

any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect

a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of

Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend

in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common

Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series

A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause

(b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by

a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock

outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the

number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

such event.



(ii) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A

Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (i) of this Section immediately after

it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a

dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no

dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during

the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share on the Series A

Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date.



(iii) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares

of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next,

preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such

shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the

date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination

of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a

quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either

of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from

such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not

bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an

amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and

payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis

among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix

a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred

Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared

thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date

fixed for the payment thereof.

#####  



(b) Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall

have the following voting rights:



(i) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share

of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on

all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the

event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the

Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or

combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of

Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then

in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of

Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall

be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which

is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such

event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock

that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(ii) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any Certificate of Designations

creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the

holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of

Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general

voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a

vote of stockholders of the Corporation.



(iii) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of

Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent

shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with

holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

#####  



(c) Certain Restrictions.



(i) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable

on the Series A Preferred. Stock as provided in Section (2) are in arrears,

thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions,

whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding

shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:



A. declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of

stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;



B. declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of

stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,

dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends

paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on

which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts

to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;



C. redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any

stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution

or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation

may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such

junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking

junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up)

to the Series A Preferred Stock; or



D. redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of

Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the

Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in

writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all

holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after

consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative

rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine

in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective

series or classes.



(ii) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to

purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the

Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (i) of this Section

(c), purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such

manner.



(d) Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or

otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be

retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares

shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of

Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock

subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in

the Certificate of Incorporation, or in any Certificate of Designations

creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise

required by law.

#####  



(e) Liquidation. Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation, dissolution

or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the

holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon

liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock

unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall

have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid

dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of

such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock

shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the

provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the

aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common

Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as

to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A

Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred

Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which

the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution

or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay

any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect

a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of

Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend

in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common

Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares

of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event

under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by

multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the

denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



(f) Consolidation, Merger. etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any

consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of

Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash

and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A

Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into

an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set

forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash

and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or

for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the

Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock

payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or

consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification

or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a

greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the

amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or

change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying

such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of

Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of

which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding

immediately prior to such event.



(g) No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be

redeemable.



(h) Rank. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment

of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other

class of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock.



(i) Amendment. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not

be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers,

preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect

them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-

thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together

as a single class.

power of the then outstanding shares of the Voting Stock of the Corporation,

voting together as a single class, voting at a stockholders’ meeting and not

the fact that no vote may be required, or that a lesser percentage may be

specified by law or in any agreement with any national securities exchange or

otherwise.

Article shall not be applicable to any particular Business Combination, and

such Business Combination shall require only such affirmative vote, if any, of

(a) Approval by Continuing Directors. The Business Combination shall have been

approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors,

even if the Continuing Directors do not constitute a quorum of the entire

Board of Directors.



(b) Form of Consideration, Price and Procedure Requirements. All of the

following conditions shall have been met:



(i) With respect to each share of each class of Voting Stock of the

Corporation (including Common Stock), the holder thereof shall be entitled to

receive on or before the date of the consummation of the Business Combination

(the “Consummation Date”), consideration, in the form specified in subsection

(3)(B)(ii) hereof, with an aggregate Fair Market Value on the Consummation

Date at least equal to the highest of the following:



A. the highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer

taxes and soliciting dealers’ fees) paid by the Interested Stockholder to

which the Business Combination relates, or by any Affiliate or Associate of

such Interested Stockholder, for any shares of such class of Voting Stock

acquired by it (1) within the two-year period immediately prior to the first

public announcement of the proposal of the Business Combination (the

“Announcement Date”) or (2) in the transaction in which it became an

Interested Stockholder, whichever is higher;



B. the Fair Market Value per share of such class of Voting Stock of the

Corporation on the Announcement Date; and



C. the highest preferential amount per share, if any, to which the holders of

shares of such class of Voting Stock of the Corporation are entitled in the

event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up

of the Corporation.



(ii) The consideration to be received by holders of a particular class of

outstanding Voting Stock of the Corporation (including Common Stock) as

described in subsection (3)(B)(i) hereof shall be in cash or if the

consideration previously paid by or on behalf of the Interested Stockholder in

connection with its acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares of such

class of Voting Stock consisted in whole or in part of consideration other

than cash, then in the same form as such consideration. If such payment for

shares of any class of Voting Stock of the Corporation has been made in

varying forms of consideration, the form of consideration for such class of

Voting Stock shall be either cash or the form used to acquire the beneficial

ownership of the largest number of shares of such class of Voting Stock

previously acquired by the Interested Stockholder.

annual rate of dividends paid on the Common Stock of the Corporation (except

and (2) an increase in such annual rate of dividends as necessary to reflect

any reclassification (including any reverse stock split), recapitalization,

reorganization or any similar transaction which has the effect of reducing the

number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, unless the failure so to

increase such annual rate is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of

the Continuing Directors; and (c) such Interested Stockholder shall not have

become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Voting Stock of the

Corporation except as part of the transaction which results in such Interested

Stockholder becoming an Interested Stockholder.

tax advantages provided by the Corporation.

Combination and complying with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the

General Rules and Regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions

replacing such Act, rules or regulations) shall be mailed to the stockholders

of the Corporation at least 45 days prior to the consummation of such Business

Combination (whether or not such proxy or information statement is required to

be mailed pursuant to such Act or subsequent provisions thereof).

shall have the power of duty to determine, on the basis of information known

whether the assets which are the subject of any Business Combination have, or

the consideration to be received for the issuance or transfer of securities by

a Corporation or any Subsidiary in any Business Combination has, an aggregate

Fair Market Value of not less than one percent (1%) of the total assets of the

Corporation as reported in the consolidated balance sheet of the Corporation

as of the end of the most recent quarter with respect to which such balance

sheet has been prepared; and the good faith determination of a majority of the

Continuing Directors on such matters shall be conclusive and binding for all

the purposes of this Article.

members of the Board of Directors or an Interested Stockholder from any

fiduciary obligation imposed by law.



(b) The fact that any Business Combination complies with the provisions of
