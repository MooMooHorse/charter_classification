<PAGE>   2



                                ARTICLE III



        The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted

is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be

organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.



                                 ARTICLE IV



        This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock, to be

designated, respectively, "Common Stock" and "Preferred Stock." The total

number of shares that this corporation is authorized to issue is Three

Hundred and Five Million (305,000,000) shares of capital stock. Of such

authorized shares, Three Hundred Million (300,000,000) shares shall be

designated "Common Stock," and have a par value of $0.001 per share, and

Five Million (5,000,000) shares shall be designated "Preferred Stock," and

have a par value of $0.001 per share.



        The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more

series, without further stockholder approval. The Board of Directors is

hereby authorized, in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of

Directors providing for the issue of any wholly unissued series of

Preferred Stock, within the limitations and restrictions stated in this

Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to fix or alter the dividend rights,

dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of

redemption (including sinking fund provisions), the redemption price or

prices, and the liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of

Preferred Stock, and the number of shares constituting any such series and

the designation thereof, or any of them, and to increase or decrease the

number of shares of any series subsequent to the issue of shares of that

series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding.

In case the number of shares of any series shall be so decreased, the

shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had

prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of

shares of such series.



                                 ARTICLE V



        Except as otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate of

Incorporation, in furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred

by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, repeal,

alter, amend, and rescind any or all of the Bylaws of this Corporation.



                                 ARTICLE VI



        The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time

exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a

majority of the total number of authorized directors (regardless of any

existing vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any

such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption).



<PAGE>   3



        Directors shall be divided into three classes, as equal in number

as reasonably possible, with the term of office of the first class to

expire at the 1999 annual meeting of stockholders, the term of office of

the second class to expire at the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders and

the term of office of the third class to expire at the 2001 annual meeting

of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders following such

initial classification and election, directors elected to succeed those

directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to

expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their

election. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of term for

which elected, and until their respective successors are elected and

qualified, except in the case of the death, resignation or removal of any

director. Directors need not be stockholders.



        Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any

increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority

of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole

remaining director, and not by stockholders, and the directors so chosen

shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors

are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are

no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the

manner provided by statute.



        The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the

direction of its board of directors, which may exercise all such powers of

the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by

statute or by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws directed

or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.



                                ARTICLE VII



        Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the

Bylaws of this corporation shall so provide.



                                ARTICLE VIII



        Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of

Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide. The books of this corporation may be

kept (subject to any provision contained in the statues) outside the State

of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time

by Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of this corporation



                                 ARTICLE IX



        A director of this corporation shall, to the fullest extent

permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as it now exists or as it

may hereafter be amended, not be liable to this corporation or its

stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a

director. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article, nor the

adoption of any provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation

inconsistent with this Article, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of

this Article in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action,

suit or claim that, but for this 



<PAGE>   4



Article, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption

of an inconsistent provision.



                                 ARTICLE X



        No action required to be taken or that may be taken at any annual

or special meeting of the stockholders of this corporation may be taken

without a meeting, and the power of stockholders to consent in writing,

without a meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically denied.



                                 ARTICLE XI



        Section 1. The corporation shall hold harmless and indemnify any

person entitled to the benefits of indemnification pursuant to this Article

XI (such person being hereinafter referred to as "Indemnitee") to the full

extent authorized or permitted by the provisions of Section 145 of the

Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the "Law"), as such may be

amended from time to time, and by this Article XI, as such may be amended.

In furtherance of the foregoing indemnification, and without limiting the

generality thereof:



                  (a) Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of

the Corporation. Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification

provided in this Section 1(a) if, by reason of his Corporate Status (as

hereinafter defined), he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or

participant in any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined) other than a Proceeding

by or in the right of the corporation. Pursuant to this Section 1(a), Indemnitee

shall be indemnified against all Expenses (as hereinafter defined), judgments,

penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred

by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue

or matter therein, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably

believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and,

with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his

conduct was unlawful.



                  (b) Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation.

Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this

Section 1(b) if, by reason of his Corporate Status, he is, or is threatened to

be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding brought by or in the right

of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section

1(b), Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and

reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding

if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not

opposed to the best interests of the corporation; provided, however, that, if

applicable law so provides, no indemnification against such Expenses shall be

made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which

Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and

to the extent than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall

determine that such indemnification may be made. 



<PAGE>   5



                  (c) Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or

Partly Successful. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XI, to

the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a party to and

is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, he shall be

indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law against all Expenses actually

and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. If

Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful on the

merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or

matters in such Proceeding, the corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against

all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in

connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. For purposes

of this Section 1 and without limitation, the termination of any claim issue or

matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be

deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. 



         Section 2. In addition to, and without regard to any limitations on,

the indemnification provided for in Section 1, the corporation shall indemnify

and hold harmless Indemnitee against all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines

and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his

behalf if, by reason of his Corporate Status he is, or is threatened to be made,

a party to or participant in any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the

right of the corporation), including, without limitation, all liability arising

out of the negligence or active or passive wrongdoing of Indemnitee. The only

limitation that shall exist upon the corporation's obligations pursuant to these

Bylaws or any indemnification agreement between the corporation and Indemnitee

shall be that the corporation shall not be obligated to make any payment to

Indemnitee that is finally determined (under the procedures, and subject to the

presumptions, set forth in Sections 6 and 7 hereof) to be unlawful under

Delaware law.



         Section 3.



                  (a) Whether or not the indemnification provided in Sections 1

and 2 hereof is available, in respect of any threatened, pending or completed

action, suit or proceeding in which corporation is jointly liable with

Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding),

corporation shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount of any judgment

or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to

contribute to such payment and corporation hereby waives and relinquishes any

right of contribution it may have against Indemnitee. The corporation shall not

enter into any settlement of any action, suit or proceeding in which corporation

is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or

proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all

claims asserted against Indemnitee.



                  (b) Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the

corporation set forth in the preceding subparagraph, if, for any reason,

Indemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment

or settlement in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding

in which corporation is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in

such action, suit or proceeding), corporation shall contribute to the amount of

expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in

settlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in

proportion to the relative benefits received by the corporation and all

officers, directors or employees of the corporation other than 



<PAGE>   6



Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such

action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand,

from the transaction from which such action, suit or proceeding arose; provided,

however, that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit may, to

the extent necessary to conform to law, be further adjusted by reference to the

relative fault of corporation and all officers, directors or employees of the

corporation other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or

would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and

Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the events that resulted in

such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other

equitable considerations which the law may require to be considered. The

relative fault of corporation and all officers, directors or employees of the

corporation other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or

would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and

Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other

things, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain

personal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or

secondary, and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive.



                  (c) The corporation shall fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee

harmless from any claims of contribution which may be brought by officers,

directors or employees of the corporation other than Indemnitee who may be

jointly liable with Indemnitee. 



         Section 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XI, to

the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a witness in

any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he shall be indemnified

against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in

connection therewith.



         Section 5. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the corporation

shall advance all reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in

connection with any Proceeding by reason of Indemnity's Corporate Status within

ten days after the receipt by the corporation of a statement or statements from

Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior

to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements

shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include

or be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to

repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee

is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. Any advances and

undertakings to repay pursuant to this Section 5 shall be unsecured and interest

free. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the corporation to

advance Expenses pursuant to this Section 5 shall be subject to the condition

that, if, when and to the extent that the corporation determines that Indemnitee

would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, the corporation

shall be entitled to be reimbursed, within thirty (30) days of such

determination, by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the corporation)

for all such amounts theretofore paid; provided, however, that if Indemnitee has

commenced or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of competent

jurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified

under applicable law, any determination made by the corporation that Indemnitee

would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be

binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the corporation for

any advance of Expenses until a final judicial determination is 



<PAGE>   7



made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been

exhausted or lapsed).



         Section 6. It is the intent of the corporation to secure for Indemnitee

rights of indemnity that are as favorable as may be permitted under the law and

public policy of the State of Delaware. Accordingly, the following procedures

and presumptions shall apply in the event of any question as to whether

Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification



                  (a) To obtain indemnification (including, but not limited to,

the advancement of Expenses and contribution by the corporation), Indemnitee

shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or

therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to

Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent

Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the corporation

shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the

Board of Directors in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.



                  (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification

pursuant to the first sentence hereof, a determination, if required by

applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made

in the specific case by one of the following three methods, which shall be at

the election of Indemnitee: (1) by a majority vote of the disinterested

directors, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by independent legal counsel

in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.



                  (c) If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is

to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof, the

Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 6(c). The

Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall

request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors). Indemnitee or

the corporation, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written

notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the corporation or to

Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided,

however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the

Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent

Counsel" as defined in Section 12 hereof, and the objection shall set form with

particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely

objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If a written

objection is made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel selected may not

serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a

court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days

after submission by Indemnitee of a written retest for indemnification pursuant

to Section 6(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not

objected to, either the corporation or Indemnitee may petition the Court of

Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for

resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the corporation or

Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the

appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such

other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom

an objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as

Independent Counsel under Section 6(b) hereof. The corporation shall pay any and

an reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such

Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof,

and the corporation shall pay an reasonable fees and expenses incident to 



<PAGE>   8



the procedures of this Section 6(c), regardless of the manner in which such

Independent Counsel was selected or appointed.



                  (d) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to

indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such

determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if

Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with

Section 6(a) hereof. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the

burden of proof and the burden of persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence.



                  (e) Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if

Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the

Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to

Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or

on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records

given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public

accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by

the Enterprise. In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of

any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed

to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under

this Article XI. Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(e)

are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that Indemnitee has at all

times acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not

opposed to the best interests of the corporation Anyone seeking to overcome this

presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion, by

clear and convincing evidence. 



                  (f) The corporation acknowledges that a settlement or other

disposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to

avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty. In the event that

any action, claim or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in

any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without

limitation, settlement of such action, claim or proceeding with or without

payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee

has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or

proceeding. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of

proof and the burden of persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence. 



                  (g) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected

under this Article XI to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to

indemnification shall not have made a determination within thirty (30) days

after receipt by the corporation of the request therefor, the requisite

determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been

made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a

misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact

necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in

connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such

indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 30 day period

may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional fifteen (15)

days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to

entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for

the obtaining or evaluating documentation and/or information relating thereto;

and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(g) shall

not apply if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made



<PAGE>   9



by the stockholders pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof and if (A) within fifteen

(15) days after receipt by the corporation of the request for such determination

the Board of Directors or the Disinterested Directors, if appropriate, resolve

to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an

annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy five (75) days after such

receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of

stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the

purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose

within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is

made thereat. 



                  (h) Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or

entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to

indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon

reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not

privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably

available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any

Independent Counsel member of the Board of Directors, or stockholder of the

corporation shall act reasonably and in good faith in making a determination

under any indemnification agreement related to the Indemnitee's entitlement to

indemnification. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and

disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons

or entity making such determination shall be borne by the corporation

(irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to

indemnification) and the corporation shall indemnify and hold Indemnitee

harmless therefrom.



         Section 7.



                  (a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to

this Article XI that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder,

(ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 5 hereof,

(iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made

pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof within 90 days after receipt by the corporation

of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made

pursuant to the terms of this Article XI or any indemnification agreement

between the corporation and the Indemnitee within ten (10) days after receipt by

the corporation of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification

is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that

Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or such determination is deemed to

have been made pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an

adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware, or in any other

court of competent jurisdiction, of his entitlement to such indemnification.

Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication within 180

days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such

proceeding pursuant to this Section 7(a). The corporation shall not oppose

Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication.



                  (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made

pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof that Indemnitee is not entitled to

indemnification, any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 7

shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, on the merits and

Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination.



                  (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to

Section 6(b) hereof that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the

corporation shall be bound by such 



<PAGE>   10



determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 7,

absent a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.



                  (d) In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 7,

seeks a judicial adjudication of his rights under, or to recover damages for

breach of, the terms of this Article XI or any indemnification agreement between

liability insurance policies maintained by the corporation the corporation shall

pay on his behalf, in advance, any and all expenses (of the types described in

the definition of Expenses in Section 12 hereof) actually and reasonably

incurred by him in such judicial adjudication, regardless of whether Indemnitee

ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of

expenses or insurance recovery. 



                  (e) The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any

judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 7 that the procedures and

presumptions of contained in this Article XI are not valid, binding and

enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court that the corporation is bound

by all the provisions of this Article XI. 



         Section 8.



                  (a) The rights of indemnification provided hereunder shall not

be deemed exclusive any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be

entitled under applicable law, the certificate of incorporation of the

corporation, any indemnification agreement between the corporation and

Indemnitee, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise.

No amendment, alteration or repeal of these Bylaws or of any provision hereof

shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee hereunder in respect of any

action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to such

amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in the Law, whether

by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification than would be

afforded currently hereunder and any indemnification agreement between the

corporation and Indemnitee, it is the intent of the parties hereto that

Indemnitee shall enjoy the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right

or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or

remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to

every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law

or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy

hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or

employment of any other right or remedy.



                  (b) To the extent that the corporation maintains an insurance

policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers,

employees, or agents or fiduciaries of the corporation or of any other

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other

enterprise which such person serves at the request of the corporation,

Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or

their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such

director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies.



                  (c) In the event of any payment pursuant to this Article XI or

any indemnification agreement between the corporation and Indemnitee shall be

subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of

Indemnitee, who shall execute all 



<PAGE>   11



papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including

execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the corporation to bring

suit to enforce such rights. 



                  (d) The corporation shall not be liable to make any payment of

amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee

has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy,

contract, agreement or otherwise.

  

         Section 9. Notwithstanding any other provision of hereunder, Indemnitee

shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to any Proceeding brought

by Indemnitee, or any claim therein, unless (a) the bringing of such Proceeding

or making of such claim shall have been approved by the Board of Directors or

(b) such Proceeding is being brought by the Indemnitee to assert his rights as

set forth herein or in any indemnification agreement between the corporation and

Indemnitee.



         Section 10. All agreements and obligations of the corporation contained

in this Article XI shall continue during the period Indemnitee is a director or

officer of the corporation (or is or was serving at the request of the

corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,

partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) and shall continue

thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any Proceeding (or any

proceeding commenced under Section 7 hereof) by reason of his Corporate Status,

whether or not he is acting or serving in any such capacity at the time any

liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification can be provided under

this Agreement. The terms of this Article XI shall be binding upon and inure to

the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective

successors (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger,

consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets

of the Company), assigns, spouses, heirs, executors and personal and legal

representatives. The terms of this Article XI shall continue in effect

regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director or officer of

the corporation or any other enterprise at the corporation's request.



         Section 11. To the extent requested by the Indemnitee and approved by

the Board of Directors, the corporation may at any time and from time to time

provide security to the Indemnitee for the corporation's obligations hereunder

through an irrevocable bank line of credit, funded trust or other collateral.

Any such security, once provided to the Indemnitee, may not be revoked or

released without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee.



         Section 12. For purposes of this Article XI:



                  (a) "Corporate Status" describes the status of a person who is

or was a director, officer, employee or agent or fiduciary of the corporation or

of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit

plan or other enterprise which such person is or was serving at the express

written request of the corporation.



                  (b) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the

corporation who is not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which

indemnification is sought by Indemnitee.



<PAGE>   12



                  (c) "Enterprise" shall mean the corporation and any other

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other

enterprise of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the express written request

of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary.



                  (d) "Expenses" shall include all reasonable attorneys' fees,

retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel

expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges,

postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the

types customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing

to prosecute or defend, investigating, participating, or being or preparing to

be a witness in a Proceeding.



                  (e) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, or a member of a

law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither

presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i)

the corporation or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other

than with respect to matters concerning the Indemnitee under this Article XI or

any indemnification agreement between the corporation and Indemnitee, or of

other indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements), or (ii) any other

party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include

any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then

prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the

corporation or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under

this Article XI or any indemnification agreement between the corporation and

Indemnitee. The corporation agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent

Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and

all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this

Article XI or any indemnification agreement between the corporation and

Indemnitee or its engagement pursuant hereto or thereto. 



                  (f) "Proceeding" includes any threatened, pending or completed

action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism,

investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened

or completed proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the corporation

or otherwise and whether civil, criminal administrative or investigative, in

which Indemnitee was, is or will be involved as a party or otherwise, by reason

of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director of the corporation, by reason

of any action taken by him or of any inaction on his part while acting as a

director of the corporation, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving

at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; in

each case whether or not he is acting or serving in any such capacity at the

time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification can be

provided under any indemnification agreement between the corporation and

Indemnitee; excluding, however, any suit initiated by an Indemnitee pursuant to

Section 7 hereof to enforce his rights under this Article XI. 



         Section 13. If any provision or provisions of this Article XI shall be

held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, illegal or

otherwise unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality

and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article XI (including

without limitation, each portion of any section of this Article XI containing

any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not

itself 



<PAGE>   13



invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired

thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law, (b)

to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article XI (including,

without limitation, each portion of any section of this Article XI containing

any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not

itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give

effect to the intent manifested thereby.



                                   ARTICLE XII



         This corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal

any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the
