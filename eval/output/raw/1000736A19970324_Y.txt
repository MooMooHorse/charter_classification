         SECTION 4.1      AUTHORIZATION OF CAPITAL.  The total number of shares

of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to

issue is Four Hundred Ten Million (410,000,000) shares, comprised of (a) Four

Hundred Million (400,000,000) shares of Common Stock, with a par value of $.001

per share; (b) Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of Series C Junior

Participating Preferred Stock (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), with a par

value of $.001 per share; and (c) Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand

(9,500,000) shares of such other Preferred Stock, with a par value of $.001 per

share, as the Board of Directors may decide to issue pursuant to Section 4.3,

which constitutes a total authorized capital of all classes of capital stock of

Four Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($410,000.00).



         A description of the respective classes of stock and a statement of

the designations, preferences, voting powers, relative, participating, optional

or other special rights and privileges, and the qualifications, limitations and

restrictions of the Series C Preferred Stock, such other Preferred Stock as the

Board of Directors may by resolution or resolutions decide to issue, and the

Common Stock are as follows:



         SECTION 4.2      SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK.



                 (a)      Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series C

Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:



                                       3

<PAGE>   4



                          (1)     Subject to the provisions for adjustment

hereinafter set forth, each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall entitle the

holder thereof to one hundred (100) votes on all matters submitted to a vote of

the stockholders of the Corporation.  In the event the Corporation shall at any

time after the Rights Declaration Date (as defined in subsection 4.2(b)) (i)

declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii)

subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common

Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of

votes per share to which holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock were

entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such

number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common

Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is

the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

such event.



                          (2)     Except as otherwise provided herein or by

law, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and the holders of

shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters

submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.



                          (3)     (A)      If at any time dividends on any

Series C Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6)

quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the

beginning of a period (herein called a "default period") which shall extend

until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous

quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all

shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared

and paid or set apart for payment.  During each default period, all holders of

Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series C Preferred Stock) with

dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon,

voting as a class irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two (2)

Directors.



                                  (B)      During any default period, such

voting right of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock may be exercised

initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subsection 4.2(a)(3)(C) or at

any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of

stockholders, provided that such voting right shall not be exercised unless the

holders of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock

outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy.  The absence of a quorum of

the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of

Series C Preferred Stock of such voting right.  At any meeting at which the

holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially

during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a

class, to elect Directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of

Directors as may then exist up to two (2) Directors or, if such right is

exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2) Directors.  If the number

which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required

number, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right to

make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit

the election by them of the required number.  After the holders of the Series C

Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect Directors in any

default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of

Directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of

Series C Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any

equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series C Preferred

Stock.



                                       4

<PAGE>   5



                                  (C)      Unless the holders of Series C

Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously

exercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or

any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten

percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock

outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special

meeting of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, which meeting shall

thereupon be called by the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the

Corporation.  Notice of such meeting and of any special meeting at which

holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this

subsection 4.2(a)(3)(C) shall be given to each holder of record of Series C

Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as

the same appears on the books of the Corporation.  Such meeting shall be called

for a time not earlier than twenty (20) days and not later than sixty (60) days

after such order or request or, in default of the calling of such meeting

within sixty (60) days after such order or request, such meeting may be called

on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate

not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred

Stock outstanding.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection

4.2(a)(3)(C), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within

sixty (60) days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual

meeting of the stockholders.



                                  (D)      In any default period, the holders

of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable,

shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the

holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect

two (2) Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the

Directors so elected by the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall continue

in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or

until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of

Directors may (except as provided in subsection 4.2(a)(3)(B) hereof) be filled

by vote of a majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the

holders of the class of stock which elected the Director whose office shall

have become vacant.  References in this Section 4.2(a)(3)(D) to Directors

elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include Directors

elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the

foregoing sentence.



                                  (E)      Immediately upon the expiration of a

default period, (x) the right of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock as a

class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by

the holders of Series C Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the

number of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in this

Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, irrespective of

any increase made pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4.2(a)(3)(B) hereof

(such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner

provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws).  Any

vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y)

and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining

Directors.



                          (4)     Except as set forth herein, holders of Series

C Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall

not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of

Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.



                                       5

                 (b)      Dividends and Distribution.



                          (1)     The holders of shares of Series C Preferred

Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of

Directors out of funds legally available for the purposes, quarterly dividends

payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September and December in each

year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first

issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock, in an

amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a)

$.001 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, one

hundred (100) times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and

one hundred (100) times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all

non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in

shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common

Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, since

the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to

the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any

share or fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock.  In the event the

Corporation shall, at any time after November 10, 1994 (the "Rights Declaration

Date"), (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common

Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the

outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such

case the amount to which holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock were

entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding

sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the

numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of

shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.



                          (2)     The Corporation shall declare a dividend or

distribution on the Series C Preferred Stock as provided in subsection

4.2(b)(1) hereof immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on

the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock);

provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been

declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend

Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a

dividend of $.001 per share on the Series C Preferred Stock shall nevertheless

be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.



                          (3)     Dividends shall begin to accrue and be

cumulative on outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock from the Quarterly

Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series

C Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the

record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case

dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such

shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is

a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of

Series C Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before

such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends

shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment

Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on

the shares of Series C Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount

of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be

allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time

outstanding.  The Board of Directors



                                       6

<PAGE>   7



may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series C

Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution

declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than thirty (30) days

prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.



                 (c)      Restrictions.



                          (1)     Whenever quarterly dividends or other

dividends or distributions payable on the Series C Preferred Stock as provided

in subsection 4.2(b) hereof are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued

and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of

Series C Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the

Corporation shall not



                                  (A)      declare or pay dividends on, make

any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for

consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or

upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series C Preferred Stock;



                                  (B)      declare or pay dividends on or make

any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as

to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series C

Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series C Preferred Stock

and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in

proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are

then entitled;



                                  (C)      redeem or purchase or otherwise

acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to

dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series C

Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase

or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of

any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon

dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series C Preferred Stock; or



                                  (D)      purchase or otherwise acquire for

consideration any shares of Series C Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock

ranking on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock, except in accordance

with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the

Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board

of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and

other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes,

shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among

the respective series or classes.



                          (2)     The Corporation shall not permit any

subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for

consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation

could, under subsection 4.2(c)(1) hereof, purchase or otherwise acquire such

shares at such time and in such manner.



                 (d)      Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series C Preferred

Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner

whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition

thereof.  All such shares shall, upon their cancellation, become



                                       7

<PAGE>   8



authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part

of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions

of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on

issuance set forth herein.



                 (e)      Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.



                          (1)     Upon any liquidation (voluntary or

otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall

be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to

dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series C

Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series C

Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to one hundred (100) times

the Exercise Price, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and

distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment

(the "Series C Liquidation Preference").  The term "Exercise Price" means the

price established by the Board of Directors for the purchase of one unit of

Series C Preferred Stock equal to one-one-hundredth of one share of Series C

Preferred Stock.  If no shares of convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding

at the time of liquidation, then, following the payment of the full amount of

the Series C Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made

to the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the

holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the

"Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series

C Liquidation Preference by (ii) one hundred (100) (as approximately adjusted

as set forth in subparagraph (3) below to reflect such events as stock splits,

stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such

number in clause (ii), the "Adjustment Number").  Following the payment of the

full amount of the Series C Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in

respect of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Common Stock,

respectively, holders of Series C Preferred Stock and holders of shares of

Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the

remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to one

(1) with respect to such Series C Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per

share basis, respectively.



                          (2)     In the event, however, that there are not

sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series C

Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of

Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series C Preferred

Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratable to the holders

of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation

preferences.  In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets

available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such

remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.



                          (3)     In the event the Corporation shall at any

time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock

payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock,

or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,

then, in each such case, the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to

such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a

fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock

outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the

number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

such event.



                                       8

<PAGE>   9



                 (f)      Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case the Corporation

shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in

which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock

or securities, cash and/or any other property, then, in any such case, the

shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly

exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for

adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to one hundred (100) times the

aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable

in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common

Stock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time

after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock

payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock,

or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,

then, in each such case, the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with

respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall

be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event

and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were

outstanding immediately prior to such event.



                 (g)      No Redemption.  The shares of Series C Preferred

Stock shall not be redeemable.



                 (h)      Amendment.  The Certificate of Incorporation of the

Corporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially

alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series C

Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of

the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series C

Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.



                 (i)      Fractional Shares.  Series C Preferred Stock may be

issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to

such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, to receive

dividends, to participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other

(9,500,000) shares, and to establish the number of shares to be included in

each such series, and to fix the designation, relative rights, preferences,

authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each such series shall

include, but not be limited to, a determination of the following:



                 (a)      The number of shares constituting that series and the

                 (c)      Whether that series shall have voting rights, in

addition to the voting rights provided by law, and, if so, the terms of such

voting rights;



                 (d)      Whether that series shall have conversion or exchange

privileges and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange,

including provision for adjustments for the conversion or exchange rate in such

events as the Board of Directors shall determine;



                 (e)      Whether or not the shares of that series shall be

redeemable and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption, including

the manner of selecting shares for redemption if less than all shares are to be

redeemed, the date or dates upon or after which they shall be redeemable, and

the amount per share payable in case of redemption, which amount may vary under

different conditions and at different redemption dates;



                 (f)      Whether that series shall be entitled to the benefit

of a sinking fund to be applied to the purchase or redemption of shares of that

                 (g)      The rights of the shares of that series to the

benefit of conditions and restrictions upon the creation of indebtedness of the

purchase, redemption or other acquisition by the Corporation or any subsidiary

of, any outstanding stock of the Corporation;



                 (h)      The right of the shares of that series in the event

of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the

Corporation and whether such rights shall be in preference to, or in other

relation to, the comparable rights of any other class or classes or series of

stock; and



                 (i)      Any other relative, participating, optional or other

special rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of that series.



         SECTION 4.4      COMMON STOCK.



                 (a)      Voting Rights.  Except as otherwise required by law

or this Certificate of Incorporation, each holder of Common Stock shall have

one vote in respect of each share of stock held by him of record on the books

of the Corporation for the election of Directors and on all matters submitted

to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.



                 (b)      Dividends.  Except as otherwise provided by the

resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance

of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4.3, the holders of shares

of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Board

of Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation which are by law available

therefor, dividends payable either in cash, in property or in shares of capital

stock.



                                       10

<PAGE>   11



                 (c)      Dissolution, Liquidation or Winding Up.  Except as

otherwise provided by the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors

providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section

4.3, in the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs

of the Corporation, after distribution in full of the preferential amounts, if

any, to be distributed to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, the

rights of the holders of Common Stock to receive any remaining assets of the

Corporation shall be as provided in subsection 4.2(e).



                                   ARTICLE V



         SECTION 5.1      GENERAL PROVISIONS.  The business and affairs of the

Corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.

The exact number of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by, or in the

manner provided in, the Bylaws of the Corporation, and may be increased or

decreased as therein provided.  Directors of the Corporation need not be

elected by ballot unless required by the Bylaws.



         SECTION 5.2      CLASSIFICATION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  The Directors

shall be divided into three (3) classes.  Each such class shall consist, as

nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of Directors, and

any remaining Directors shall be included within such groups as the Board of

Directors shall designate.  The first class of Directors will be elected for a

term which expires in 1996.  The second class will be elected for a term which

expires in 1997.  The third class will be elected to a term which expires in

1998.  At each annual meeting of stockholders, beginning in 1996, successors to

the class of Directors whose term expires at the annual meeting shall be

elected for a three-year term.  If the number of Directors is changed, any

increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain

the number of Directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no

case shall a decrease in the number of Directors shorten the term of any

incumbent Director.  A Director may be removed from office for cause only and,

subject to such removal, death, resignation, retirement or disqualification,

shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term

expires and until his successor shall be elected and qualify.  No alteration,

amendment or repeal of this Article V or the Bylaws of the Corporation shall be

effective to shorten the term of any Director holding office at the time of

such alteration, amendment or repeal, to permit any such Director to be removed

without cause, or to increase the number of Directors in any class or in the

aggregate from that existing at the time of such alteration, amendment or

repeal until the expiration of the terms of office of all Directors then

holding office, unless (i) in the case of this Article V, such alteration,

amendment or repeal has been approved by the holders of all shares of stock

entitled to vote thereon, or (ii) in the case of the Bylaws, such alteration,

amendment or repeal has been approved by either the holders of all shares

entitled to vote thereon or by a vote of a majority of the entire Board of

Directors.



         SECTION 5.3      DIRECTORS APPOINTED BY A SPECIFIC CLASS OF

STOCKHOLDERS.  To the extent that any holders of any class or series of stock

other than Common Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the separate

right, voting as a class or series, to elect Directors, the Directors elected

by such class or series shall be deemed to constitute an additional class of

Directors and shall have a term of office for one year or such other period as

may be designated by the provisions of such class



                                       11

<PAGE>   12



or series providing such separate voting right to the holders of such class or

series of stock, and any such class of Directors shall be in addition to the

classes designated above.



         SECTION 5.4      NOMINATIONS.  Advance notice of nominations for the

election of Directors shall be given in the manner and to the extent provided

in the Bylaws of the Corporation.



         SECTION 5.5      VACANCIES.  Vacancies and newly created directorships

resulting from any increase in the authorized number of Directors may be filled

by a majority of the Board of Directors, and any vacancies on the Board of

Directors resulting from death, resignation, removal or other cause shall only

be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then

in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a

sole remaining Director.  Any Director elected in accordance with the preceding

sentence of this Section 5.5 shall hold office for the remainder of the full

term of the Directors whose vacancy is so filled and until such Director's

successor shall have been elected and qualified.



                                   ARTICLE VI



         The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.



                                  ARTICLE VII



         In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it

by law, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized:



         SECTION 7.1      To adopt, repeal, alter or amend the Bylaws of the

Corporation by a vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.



         SECTION 7.2      To authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and

liens upon the real and personal property of the Corporation.



         SECTION 7.3      To set apart, out of any of the funds of the

Corporation available for dividends, a reserve or reserves for any proper

purpose and to abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.



         SECTION 7.4      By a majority of the whole Board of Directors, to

designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of

the Directors of the Corporation.  The Board of Directors may designate one or

more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any

absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.  The Bylaws may

provide that, in the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee,

the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from

voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint

another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of

any such absent or disqualified member.  Any such committee, to the extent

provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, or in the Bylaws of the

Corporation, shall



                                       12

<PAGE>   13



have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in

the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may

authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may

require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in

reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation, adopting an agreement

of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or

exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets,

recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a

revocation of a dissolution, or amending the Bylaws of the Corporation; and,

unless the resolution or Bylaws expressly so provide, no such committee shall

have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance

of stock.



         SECTION 7.5      When and as authorized by the stockholders in

accordance with statute, to sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of

the property and assets of the Corporation, including its goodwill and its

corporate franchises, upon such terms and conditions and for such

consideration, which may consist in whole or in part of money or property,

including shares of stock in and/or other securities of any other corporation

or corporations, as the Board of Directors shall deem expedient and for the

best interests of the Corporation.



                                  ARTICLE VIII



         SECTION 8.1      Except as provided in Section 8.2 of this Article

VIII, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the

Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the

stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in

writing by such stockholders.  Advance notice of items of business to be

considered at any meeting of the stockholders shall be given in the manner and

to the extent provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation.



         SECTION 8.2      Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Article VIII

shall not apply to the Corporation if it does not have a class of voting stock

that is either (i) listed on a national securities exchange, (ii) authorized

for quotation on an inter dealer quotation system of the registered national

securities association, or (iii) held of record by more than two thousand

(2,000) stockholders.



                                   ARTICLE IX



         SECTION 9.1      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS.  A Director of

the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its

stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director,

except for liability (i) for any breach of the Director's duty of loyalty to

the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good

faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,

(iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the

Director derived an improper personal benefit.



                          If the DGCL is amended after the date hereof to

authorized action by corporations organized pursuant to the DGCL to further

eliminate or limit the personal liability of



                                       13

<PAGE>   14



directors, then the liability of a Director of the Corporation shall be

eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as amended.



         SECTION 9.2      INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS.



                 (a)      Each person who was or is made a party to, or is

threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in, any threatened, pending or

completed action, suit or proceeding, whether formal or informal, whether of a

civil, criminal, administrative or investigative nature (hereinafter a

"proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or

she is the legal representative, is or was a Director of the Corporation,

whether the basis of such proceeding is an alleged action or inaction in an

official capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, shall

be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent

permissible under Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter exist in

the future (but, in the case of any future change, only to the extent that such

change permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than

the law permitted prior to such change), against all costs, charges, expenses,

liabilities and losses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees,

judgments, fines, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA")

excise taxes, or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)

reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith, and

such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a

Director and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and

administrators.



                 (b)      The Corporation shall pay expenses actually incurred

in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition;

provided, however, that if Delaware law then requires, the payment of such

expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be

made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf

of such Director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall

ultimately be determined that such Director or officer is not entitled to be

indemnified.



                 (c)      If a claim under subsection 9.2(a) hereof is not paid

in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has

been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring

suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if

successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also

the expense of prosecuting such claim.  Neither the failure of the Corporation

(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its

stockholders) to have made a determination that indemnification of the claimant

is permissible in the circumstances because the claimant has met the applicable

standard of conduct, if any, nor an actual determination by the Corporation

(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its

stockholders) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct, shall be a

defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the

standard of conduct.



         SECTION 9.3      INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.

The Corporation may provide indemnification to employees and agents of the

Corporation to the fullest extent permissible under Delaware law.



                                       14

<PAGE>   15



         SECTION 9.4      EXPENSES AS A WITNESS.  To the extent that any

Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation is, by reason of such

position, or position with another entity at the request of the Corporation, a

witness in any action, suit or proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified

against all costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her

on his or her behalf in connection therewith.



         SECTION 9.5      INSURANCE.  The Corporation may maintain insurance,

at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent

of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or

other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not

the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such

expense, liability or loss under Delaware law.



         SECTION 9.6      INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS.  The Corporation may enter into

agreements with any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation

providing for indemnification to the fullest extent permissible under Delaware

law.



         SECTION 9.7      SEPARABILITY.  Each and every paragraph, sentence,

term and provision of this Article IX is separate and distinct, so that if any

paragraph, sentence, term or provision hereof shall be held to be invalid or

unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not

affect the validity or enforceability of any other paragraph, sentence, term or

provision hereof.  To the extent required, any paragraph, sentence, term or

provision of this Article IX may be modified by a court of competent

jurisdiction to preserve its validity and to provide the claimant with, subject

to the limitations set forth in this Article IX and any agreement between the

Corporation and claimant, the broadest possible indemnification permitted under

applicable law.



         SECTION 9.8      CONTRACT RIGHT.  Each of the rights conferred on

Directors of the Corporation by Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.4 of this Article IX,

and on officers, employees or agents of the Corporation by Section 9.4 of this

Article, shall be a contract right, and any repeal or amendment of the

provisions of this Article shall not adversely affect any right hereunder of

any person existing at the time of such repeal or amendment with respect to any

act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or amendment, and,

further, shall not apply to any proceeding, irrespective of when the proceeding

is initiated, arising from the service of such person prior to such repeal or

amendment.



         SECTION 9.9      NONEXCLUSIVITY.  The rights conferred in this Article

shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any person may have or

hereafter acquire under any statute, Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or

disinterested Directors or otherwise.



                                   ARTICLE X



         The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter or repeal any

provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or

hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders

herein are subject to this reservation.
