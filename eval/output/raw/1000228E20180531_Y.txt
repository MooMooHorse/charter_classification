amended (the Exchange Act), or any successor thereto, and the written

consent of each such nominee to serve if elected, and (v) if applicable, all

other information that would be required to be filed with the Securities and

day in each year as may be determined by resolution adopted by the affirmative

vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors. Special meetings of

stockholders may be called at any time only at the direction of the Chairman

directors. Annual and special meetings of stockholders shall not be called or

held otherwise than as herein provided. Except as otherwise provided by law or

by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, at any meeting of

stockholders of the Corporation, the presence in person or by proxy of the

holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding stock of the

Corporation entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of

business brought before the meeting in accordance with this Amended and

Restated Certificate of Incorporation and, a quorum being present, the

affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock of the

Corporation present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote

shall be required to effect action by stockholders; provided, however, that

the By-laws of the Corporation may establish alternative procedures for the

election of directors, as permitted by law. Election of directors need not be

by written ballot. At every meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board

of Directors, or, in the absence of such officer, the President, and in the

absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President, such

officer or other person as shall be designated in accordance with the By-laws

of the Corporation, shall act as Chairman of the meeting. The Chairman of the

meeting shall have sole authority to prescribe the agenda and rules of order

for the conduct of each meeting of stockholders and to determine all questions

arising thereat relating to the order of business and the conduct of the

meeting, except as otherwise required by law.



THIRD: The written amendment effected herein was authorized by a majority of

all of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon pursuant to Section 242

of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
