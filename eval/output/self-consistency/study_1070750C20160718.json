If the Corporation calls for redemption any shares of Class E Preferred\n\nStock pursuant to and in accordance with such provisions of Article VIII of\n\nthe Charter and this Section 5(c), then, anything in the Charter to the\n\ncontrary notwithstanding, the redemption price for such shares will be an\n\namount in cash equal to $25.00 per share together with (except as provided in\n\nSection 6(f) below) all accrued and unpaid dividends to the date fixed for\n\nredemption (the \u0093Charter Redemption Price\u0094). Anything in the Charter to the\n\ncontrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this Section 5(c) shall apply only\n\nto the redemption of Class E Preferred Stock pursuant to Article VIII (or any\n\nsimilar provisions) of the Charter and not to any other purchase or\n\nacquisition of shares of Class E Preferred Stock pursuant to Article VIII (or\n\nany similar provisions) of the Charter.\n\n\n\n(d) Any redemption of shares of Class E Preferred Stock, whether pursuant to\n\nparagraph (b) or (c) of this Section 5, will be made in accordance with the\n\napplicable provisions set forth in Section 6 below.\n\n\n\n6\\. Procedures for Redemption; Limitations on Redemption.\n\n\n\n(a) If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Class E Preferred Stock are\n\nto be redeemed at the option of the Corporation pursuant to Section 5(b)\n\nabove, the number of shares to be redeemed will be determined by the\n\nCorporation and the shares to be so redeemed will be selected by the\n\nCorporation pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion\n\nto the number of such shares held by such holders (as nearly as may be\n\npracticable without creating fractional shares) or by lot or by any other\n\nequitable manner determined by the Corporation that will not result in the\n\ntransfer of any shares of Class E Preferred Stock to a trust for the benefit\n\nof a charitable beneficiary pursuant to Article VIII (or any similar\n\nprovision) of the Charter.\n\n\n\n(b) Notice of redemption will be given by publication in The Wall Street\n\nJournal or, if such newspaper is not then being published, another newspaper\n\nof general circulation in The City of New York, such publication to be made at\n\nleast once a\n\n\n\n-10- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nweek for two successive weeks commencing not less than 30 nor more than 60\n\ndays prior to the Redemption Date, except that no such notice need be\n\npublished in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5(c) above. Notice\n\nof any redemption (whether pursuant to Section 5(b) or 5(c) above, as the case\n\nmay be) will also be mailed by or on behalf of the Corporation, first class\n\npostage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the\n\napplicable Redemption Date, addressed to each holder of record of shares of\n\nClass E Preferred Stock to be redeemed at the address set forth in the share\n\ntransfer records of the Corporation; provided, that if the Corporation\n\nreasonably concludes, based upon the advice of independent tax counsel\n\nexperienced in such matters, that any redemption made pursuant to Section 5(c)\n\nmust be made on a date (the \u0093Early Redemption Date\u0094) which is earlier than 30\n\ndays after the date of such mailing in order to preserve the status of the\n\nCorporation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the status of the\n\nOperating Partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or to\n\ncomply with federal tax laws relating to the Corporation\u0092s qualification as a\n\nREIT, then the Corporation may give such shorter notice as is necessary to\n\neffect such redemption on the Early Redemption Date. Any notice which has been\n\nmailed in the manner provided for in the preceding sentence will be\n\nconclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or\n\nnot the applicable holder receives such notice. In addition to any information\n\nrequired by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which Class E\n\nPreferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice will state:\n\n(1) the Redemption Date; (2) the Optional Redemption Price or the Charter\n\nRedemption Price, as the case may be (the \u0093Redemption Price\u0094); (3) the number\n\nof shares of Class E Preferred Stock to be redeemed and whether such shares\n\nare being redeemed at the option of the Corporation pursuant to Section 5(b)\n\nor in order to preserve the Corporation\u0092s status as a real estate investment\n\ntrust for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 5(c); (4) the place\n\nor places (which will include a place in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of\n\nNew York) where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment\n\nof the Redemption Price; and (5) that dividends on the shares of Class E\n\nPreferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date.\n\nIf fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Class E Preferred Stock are to\n\nbe redeemed, the notice mailed to each holder of shares to be redeemed will\n\nalso specify the number of shares of Class E Preferred Stock to be redeemed\n\nfrom such holder. No failure to mail or defect in such mailed notice or in the\n\nmailing thereof will affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption\n\nof any shares of Class E Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom\n\nnotice was defective or not given.\n\n\n\n(c) If notice has been published (with respect to a redemption pursuant to\n\nSection 5(b) only) and mailed in accordance with Section 6(b) above and all\n\nfunds necessary for such redemption have been irrevocably set aside by the\n\nCorporation on or before the Redemption Date specified in such notice,\n\nseparate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the benefit of the\n\nholders of the Class E Preferred Stock so called for redemption, so as to be,\n\nand to continue to be, available therefor, then, from and after the Redemption\n\nDate, dividends on the shares of Class E Preferred Stock so called for\n\nredemption will cease to accrue, such shares will no longer be deemed to be\n\noutstanding, and all rights of the holders thereof as holders of such shares\n\n(except the right to receive the Redemption Price together with, if\n\napplicable, accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the Redemption Date) will\n\nterminate. In the event any Redemption Date is not a\n\n\n\n-11- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nBusiness Day, then payment of the Redemption Price may be made on the next\n\nsucceeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such\n\nRedemption Date and no interest, additional dividends or other sum will accrue\n\non the amount payable for the period from and after such Redemption Date to\n\nsuch next succeeding Business Day.\n\n\n\n(d) Upon surrender, in accordance with such notice, of the certificates for\n\nany shares of Class E Preferred Stock to be so redeemed (properly endorsed or\n\nassigned for transfer, if the Corporation so requires and the redemption\n\nnotice so states), such shares of Class E Preferred Stock will be redeemed by\n\nthe Corporation at the Redemption Price. In case fewer than all the shares of\n\nClass E Preferred Stock represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a\n\nnew certificate or certificates will be issued representing the unredeemed\n\nshares of Class E Preferred Stock without cost to the holder thereof.\n\n\n\n(e) Any deposit of monies with a bank or trust company for the purpose of\n\nredeeming Class E Preferred Stock will be irrevocable and such monies will be\n\nheld in trust for the benefit of the holders of Class E Preferred Stock\n\nentitled thereto, except that (1) the Corporation will be entitled to receive\n\nfrom such bank or trust company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned\n\non the monies so deposited in trust; and (2) any balance of the monies so\n\ndeposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the holders of the Class E\n\nPreferred Stock entitled thereto at the expiration of two years from the\n\napplicable Redemption Date will be repaid, together with any interest or other\n\nearnings earned thereon, to the Corporation and, after any such repayment, the\n\nholders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the Corporation will\n\nlook only to the Corporation for payment without interest or other earnings\n\nthereon.\n\n\n\n(f) Anything in the Charter to the contrary notwithstanding, the holders of\n\nrecord of shares of Class E Preferred Stock at the close of business on a\n\nRecord Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with respect to\n\nsuch shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the\n\nredemption of such shares after such Record Date and on or prior to such\n\nDividend Payment Date or the Corporation\u0092s default in the payment of the\n\ndividend due on such Dividend Payment Date, in which case the amount payable\n\nupon redemption of such shares of Class E Preferred Stock will not include the\n\ndividend payable on such Dividend Payment Date and the full amount of the\n\ndividend payable on such Dividend Payment Date will instead be paid on such\n\nDividend Payment Date to the holders of record at the close of business on\n\nsuch Record Date as aforesaid. Except as provided in this Section 6(f) and\n\nexcept to the extent that accrued and unpaid dividends are payable as part of\n\nthe Redemption Price pursuant to Section 5, the Corporation will make no\n\npayment or allowance for unpaid dividends, regardless of whether or not in\n\narrears, on shares of Class E Preferred Stock called for redemption.\n\n\n\n(g) Unless full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Class E\n\nPreferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and\n\npaid or authorized, declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set\n\napart for payment for all past Dividend Periods (including, without\n\nlimitation, any Dividend Period that\n\n\n\n-12- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nterminates on the date of any redemption of shares of Class E Preferred Stock\n\nreferred to below or on the date of any direct or indirect purchase or other\n\nacquisition of shares of Class E Preferred Stock referred to below, as the\n\ncase may be), (i) no shares of Class E Preferred Stock will be redeemed unless\n\nall outstanding shares of Class E Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed;\n\nprovided, however, that the foregoing will not prevent the redemption,\n\nrepurchase or acquisition of shares of Class E Preferred Stock pursuant to\n\nArticle VIII (or any similar provision) of the Charter in order to preserve\n\nthe status of the Corporation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the\n\nstatus of the Operating Partnership as a partnership for federal income tax\n\npurposes or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to\n\nthe holders of all outstanding shares of Class E Preferred Stock, and (ii) the\n\nCorporation will not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly,\n\nany shares of Class E Preferred Stock (except by conversion into or exchange\n\nfor capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Class E Preferred\n\nStock as to the payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon\n\nliquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Corporation); provided,\n\nhowever, that the foregoing will not prevent the redemption, purchase or\n\nacquisition of shares of Class E Preferred Stock pursuant to Article VIII (or\n\nany similar provision) of the Charter in order to preserve the status of the\n\nCorporation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the status of the\n\nOperating Partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or\n\npursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of\n\nall outstanding shares of Class E Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n7\\. Voting Rights. Except as set forth below in this Section 7, the holders of\n\nthe Class E Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights.\n\n\n\n(a) Whenever dividends on any shares of Class E Preferred Stock are in arrears\n\nfor six or more Dividend Periods, whether or not such Dividend Periods are\n\nconsecutive, the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors\n\nof the Corporation will be automatically increased by two (if not already\n\nincreased by two by reason of the election of directors by the holders of any\n\nother class or series of capital stock of the Corporation upon which like\n\nvoting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and with which the Class\n\nE Preferred Stock is entitled to vote as a class with respect to the election\n\nof such two directors) and the holders of shares of Class E Preferred Stock\n\n(voting together as a single class with all other classes or series of capital\n\nstock of the Corporation upon which like voting rights have been conferred and\n\nare exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Class E\n\nPreferred Stock in the election of such two directors) will be entitled to\n\nvote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the\n\nCorporation at a special meeting called by an officer of the Corporation at\n\nthe request of the holders of record of at least 10% of the outstanding shares\n\nof Class E Preferred Stock or by the holders of any other class or series of\n\ncapital stock of the Corporation upon which like voting rights have been\n\nconferred and are exercisable and which is entitled to vote as a class with\n\nthe Class E Preferred Stock in the election of such two additional directors\n\n(unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for\n\nthe next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, in\n\nwhich case the vote for such two directors will be held at the earlier of the\n\nnext such annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent\n\nannual meeting of stockholders, until all dividends accumulated on the Class E\n\nPreferred Stock\n\n\n\n-13- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nfor all past Dividend Periods and the then current Dividend Period have been\n\nfully paid or authorized and declared and a sum sufficient for the payment\n\nthereof set aside for payment in full, whereupon the right of the holders of\n\nClass E Preferred Stock to elect such two directors will cease and (unless\n\nthere are one or more other classes or series of capital stock of the\n\nCorporation upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are\n\nexercisable) the term of office of such two directors previously so elected\n\nwill immediately and automatically terminate, such directors will no longer be\n\nqualified to serve and the authorized number of directors of the Corporation\n\nwill thereupon return to the number of authorized directors otherwise in\n\neffect, but subject always to the same provisions for the reinstatement and\n\ndivestment of the right to elect such two additional directors in the case of\n\nany such future dividend arrearage.\n\n\n\nIn the case of any such request for a special meeting (unless such request is\n\nreceived less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or\n\nspecial meeting of stockholders), such meeting will be held on the earliest\n\npracticable date at the place designated by the holders of capital stock\n\nrequesting such meeting or, if none, at a place designated by the Corporate\n\nSecretary of the Corporation, upon notice similar to that required for an\n\nannual meeting of stockholders. If such special meeting is not called by an\n\nofficer of the Corporation within 30 days after such request, then the holders\n\nof record of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Class E Preferred Stock\n\nmay designate in writing a holder of Class E Preferred Stock to call such\n\nmeeting at the expense of the Corporation, and such meeting may be called by\n\nthe holder so designated upon notice similar to that required for an annual\n\nmeetings of stockholders and will be held at the place designated by the\n\nholder calling such meeting. At all times that the voting rights conferred by\n\nthis Section 7(a) are exercisable, the holders of Class E Preferred Stock will\n\nhave access to the stock transfer records of the Corporation. The Corporation\n\nwill pay all costs and expenses of calling and holding any meeting and of\n\nelecting directors pursuant to this Section 7(a), including, without\n\nlimitation, the cost of preparing, reproducing and mailing the notice of such\n\nmeeting, the cost of renting a room for such meeting to be held, and the cost\n\nof collecting and tabulating votes.\n\n\n\nThe procedures in this Section 7(a) for the calling of meetings and the\n\nelection of directors will, to the extent permitted by law, supersede anything\n\ninconsistent contained in the Charter or Bylaws of the Corporation and,\n\nwithout limitation to the foregoing, the provisions of Sections 13(a)(2) and\n\n13(b) of Article II of the Bylaws of the Corporation will not be applicable to\n\nthe election of directors by holders of Class E Preferred Stock pursuant to\n\nthis Section 7. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 of Article III of\n\nthe Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the limitations on the number of\n\ndirectors set forth in Article VII of the Charter, the number of directors\n\nconstituting the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation will be\n\nautomatically increased to include the directors to be elected pursuant to\n\nthis Section 7(a).\n\n\n\nSo long as any shares of Class E Preferred Stock are outstanding, the number\n\nof directors constituting the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation\n\nwill at all times be such so that the exercise, by the holders of the Class E\n\nPreferred Stock and the holders of any other classes or series of capital\n\nstock of the Corporation upon which like voting rights have been conferred, of\n\nthe right to elect directors under the\n\n\n\n-14- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\ncircumstances provided above will not contravene any provision of the\n\nCorporation\u0092s Charter or Bylaws restricting the number of directors which may\n\nconstitute the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation.\n\n\n\nIf at any time when the voting rights conferred upon the Class E Preferred\n\nStock pursuant to this Section 7(a) are exercisable, any vacancy in the office\n\nof a director elected pursuant to this Section 7(a) occurs, then such vacancy\n\nmay be filled only by the remaining director elected pursuant to this Section\n\n7(a) or by vote of the holders of record of the outstanding Class E Preferred\n\nStock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation upon\n\nwhich like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are\n\nentitled to vote as a class with the Class E Preferred Stock in the election\n\nof directors pursuant to this Section 7(a). Any director elected or appointed\n\npursuant to this Section 7(a) may be removed only by the holders of the\n\noutstanding Class E Preferred Stock and any other classes or series of capital\n\nstock of the Corporation upon which like voting rights have been conferred and\n\nare exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Class E\n\nPreferred Stock in the election of directors pursuant to this Section 7(a),\n\nand may not be removed by the holders of the Common Stock.\n\n\n\n(b) So long as any shares of Class E Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the\n\nCorporation will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders\n\nof at least two-thirds of the shares of Class E Preferred Stock outstanding at\n\nthe time, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting (with\n\nthe Class E Preferred Stock voting separately as a class), (A) authorize,\n\ncreate or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or\n\nseries of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Class E\n\nPreferred Stock as to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets\n\nupon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or reclassify\n\nany authorized capital stock of the Corporation into such shares, or create,\n\nauthorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into, exchangeable\n\nor exercisable for, or evidencing the right to purchase, any such shares, or\n\n(B) amend, alter or repeal any provisions of the Charter, whether by the\n\nmerger, consolidation or otherwise (an \u0093Event\u0094), so as to materially and\n\nadversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Class\n\nE Preferred Stock; provided, however, with respect to the occurrence of any\n\nEvent, so long as each share of Class E Preferred Stock then outstanding\n\nremains outstanding or is converted into like securities of the surviving or\n\nresulting entity, in each case with the preferences, rights, privileges,\n\nvoting powers and other terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into\n\naccount that upon the occurrence of an Event the Corporation may not be the\n\nsurviving entity and the surviving entity may be a non-corporate entity, such\n\nas a limited liability company, limited partnership or business trust, in\n\nwhich case the Class E Preferred Stock would be converted into an equity\n\ninterest, other than capital stock, having preferences, rights, privileges,\n\nvoting powers and other terms which are materially unchanged from those of the\n\nClass E Preferred Stock, the occurrence of such Event will not be deemed to\n\nmaterially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting\n\npowers of the Class E Preferred Stock; and provided, further, that (i) any\n\nincrease in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock or Common Stock, (ii) any\n\nincrease in the amount of authorized shares of Class E Preferred Stock, or\n\n(iii) the creation, issuance or increase in the amount of authorized shares of\n\nany other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, in each\n\n\n\n-15- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\ncase ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class E Preferred Stock as to\n\nthe payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up of the Corporation, will not be deemed to materially\n\nand adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.\n\nFor purposes of this paragraph, the filing in accordance with applicable law\n\nof articles supplementary or any similar document setting forth or changing\n\nthe designations, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers,\n\nrestrictions, limitation as to dividends, qualifications or other terms of any\n\nclass or series of capital stock of the Corporation will be deemed an\n\namendment to the Charter.\n\n\n\n(c) The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time\n\nwhen the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required is\n\neffected, all outstanding shares of Class E Preferred Stock have been redeemed\n\nor called for redemption and sufficient funds have been deposited in trust in\n\naccordance with the terms of Section 6 hereof to effect such redemption.\n\n\n\n(d) On any matter submitted to a vote of the holders of Class E Preferred\n\nStock or on which the Class E Preferred Stock otherwise is entitled to vote\n\n(as expressly provided in the Charter), including any action by written\n\nconsent, each share of Class E Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote, except\n\nthat when shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock of the\n\nCorporation have the right to vote with the Class E Preferred Stock as a\n\nsingle class on any matter, the Class E Preferred Stock and the shares of each\n\nsuch other class or series will have one vote for each $25.00 of liquidation\n\npreference (excluding accrued dividends). The provisions of this paragraph\n\nwill supersede any inconsistent provisions of the Bylaws of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n8\\. Conversion. The Class E Preferred Stock is not convertible into or\n\nexchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n9\\. Office or Agency in New York City. The Corporation will at all times\n\nmaintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New\n\nYork, where shares of Class E Preferred Stock may be surrendered for payment\n\n(including upon redemption), registration of transfer or exchange.\n\n\n\n10\\. No Preemptive Rights. The Class E Preferred Stock has no preemptive\n\nrights.\n\n\n\n11\\. Status of Redeemed and Reacquired Class E Preferred Stock. In the event\n\nany shares of Class E Preferred Stock are redeemed pursuant to Section 5\n\nhereof or otherwise reacquired by the Corporation, the shares so redeemed or\n\nreacquired will become authorized but unissued shares of Class E Preferred\n\nStock, available for future issuance and reclassification by the Corporation.\n\n\n\n12\\. Severability. If any preference, right, voting power, restriction,\n\nlimitation as to dividends or other distributions, qualification, term or\n\ncondition of redemption or other term of the Class E Preferred Stock is\n\ninvalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law\n\nor public policy, then, to the extent permitted by law, all other preferences,\n\nrights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends\n\n\n\n-16- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nor other distributions, qualifications, terms or conditions of redemption and\n\nother terms of the Class E Preferred Stock which can be given effect without\n\nthe invalid, unlawful or unenforceable preference, right, voting power,\n\nrestriction, limitation as to dividends or other distributions, qualification,\n\nterm or condition of redemption or other term of the Class E Preferred Stock\n\nwill remain in full force and effect and will not be deemed dependent upon any\n\nother such preference, right, voting power, restriction, limitation as to\n\ndividends, qualification, term or condition of redemption or other term of the\n\nClass E Preferred Stock unless so expressed herein.\n\n\n\nARTICLE VII\n\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\n\nSection 7(a) Number of Directors.

If a member of the Board of Directors requests that\n\nthe Board of Directors grant an exception pursuant to this subparagraph (a)\n\nwith respect to such member, or with respect to any other Person if such Board\n\nmember would be considered to be the Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of\n\nshares of Capital Stock owned by such other Person, such member of the Board\n\nof Directors shall not participate in the decision of the Board of Directors\n\nas to whether to grant any such exception.\n\n\n\n(b) In addition to exceptions permitted under subparagraph (a) above, the\n\nBoard of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, may grant to any\n\nPerson who makes a request therefor (a \u0093Requesting Person\u0094) an exception from\n\nthe Ownership Limit (or one or more elements thereof) if: (i) such Person\n\nsubmits to the Board of Directors information satisfactory to the Board of\n\nDirectors, in its reasonable discretion, demonstrating that such Requesting\n\nPerson is not an individual for purposes of Section 542(a)(2) of the Code\n\n(determined taking into account Section 856(h)(3)(A) of the Code); (ii) such\n\nRequesting Person submits to the Board of Directors information satisfactory\n\nto the Board of Directors, in its reasonable discretion, demonstrating that no\n\nPerson who is an individual for purposes of Section 542(a)(2) of the Code\n\n(determined taking into account Section 856(h)(3)(A) of the Code) would be\n\nconsidered to Beneficially Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of the\n\nOwnership Limit by reason of the Requesting Person\u0092s ownership of shares of\n\nCapital Stock in excess of the Ownership Limit pursuant to the exception\n\ngranted under this subparagraph (b); (iii) such Requesting Person submits to\n\nthe Board of Directors information satisfactory to the Board of Directors, in\n\nits reasonable discretion, demonstrating that neither clause (2) nor clause\n\n(3) of subparagraph (a)(ii) of Section 8.2.1 will be violated by reason of the\n\nRequesting Person\u0092s ownership of shares of Capital Stock in excess of the\n\nOwnership Limit pursuant to the exception granted under this subparagraph (b);\n\nand (iv) such Requesting Person\n\n\n\n-26- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nprovides to the Board of Directors such representations and undertakings, if\n\nany, as the Board of Directors may, in its sole and absolute discretion,\n\nrequire to ensure that the conditions in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) hereof\n\nare satisfied and will continue to be satisfied throughout the period during\n\nwhich such Requesting Person owns shares of Capital Stock in excess of the\n\nOwnership Limit pursuant to any exception thereto granted under this\n\nsubparagraph (b), and such Requesting Person agrees that any violation of such\n\nrepresentations and undertakings or any attempted violation thereof will\n\nresult in the application of the remedies set forth in Section 8.2 with\n\nrespect to shares of Capital Stock held in excess of the Ownership Limit with\n\nrespect to such Requesting Person (determined without regard to the exception\n\ngranted such Requesting Person under this subparagraph (b)).\n\n\n\n(c) Prior to granting any exception or exemption pursuant to subparagraph (a)\n\nor (b), the Board of Directors may require a ruling from the IRS or an opinion\n\nof counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board of\n\nDirectors, in its sole and absolute discretion as it may deem necessary or\n\nadvisable in order to determine or ensure the Corporation\u0092s status as a REIT;\n\nprovided, however, that the Board of Directors shall not be obligated to\n\nrequire obtaining a favorable ruling or opinion in order to grant an exception\n\nhereunder.\n\n\n\n(d) Subject to Section 8.2.1(a)(ii), an underwriter that participates in a\n\npublic offering or a private placement of shares of Capital Stock (or\n\nsecurities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Capital Stock) may\n\nBeneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock (or securities\n\nconvertible into or exchangeable for shares of Capital Stock) in excess of the\n\nOwnership Limit, but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such public\n\noffering or private placement; and provided, that the ownership of shares of\n\nCapital Stock by such underwriter would not result in the Corporation being\n\n\u0093closely held\u0094 within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code, or otherwise\n\nresult in the Corporation\u0092s failing to qualify as a REIT. In this regard, at\n\nno time may either (x) an underwriter, or (y) any Person who would\n\nConstructively Own shares of Capital Stock owned by an underwriter\n\nConstructively Own, concurrently, 10% or more of the outstanding securities of\n\nany class or series of (i) the Corporation and any tenant or lessee of the\n\nCorporation (which, as of the Effective Date, includes Crestline Capital\n\nCorporation and its subsidiaries), or (ii) the Corporation and any Person that\n\nwould be considered to Constructively Own or Beneficially Own 10% or more of\n\nany tenant or lessee of the Corporation (which, as of the Effective Date,\n\nincludes Crestline Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries).\n\n\n\n(e) The Board of Directors may only reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an\n\nExcepted Holder: (1) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder at any\n\ntime or (2) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and\n\nundertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the\n\nestablishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. No\n\nExcepted Holder Limit shall be reduced to a percentage that is less than the\n\nOwnership Limit.\n\n\n\n-27- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSection 8.2.8 Increase or Decrease in Ownership Limit. The Board of Directors\n\nmay from time to time increase or decrease the Ownership Limit, subject to the\n\nlimitations provided in this Section 8.2.8.\n\n\n\n(a) Any decrease may be made only prospectively as to subsequent holders\n\n(other than a decrease as a result of a retroactive change in existing law, in\n\nwhich case such change shall be effective immediately).\n\n\n\n(b) The Ownership Limit may not be increased if, after giving effect to such\n\nincrease, five Persons who are considered individuals pursuant to Section 542\n\nof the Code, as modified by Section 856(h)(3) of the Code (taking into account\n\nall of the Excepted Holders), could Beneficially Own, in the aggregate, more\n\nthan 49.5% of the value of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock.\n\n\n\n(c) Prior to the modification of the Ownership Limit pursuant to this Section\n\n8.2.8, the Board of Directors may require such opinions of counsel,\n\naffidavits, undertakings or agreements as it may deem necessary or advisable\n\nin order to determine or ensure the Corporation\u0092s status as a REIT if the\n\nmodification in the Ownership Limit were to be made.\n\n\n\nSection 8.2.9 Legend. Each certificate for shares of Capital Stock (or\n\nsecurities exercisable for or convertible into shares of Capital Stock) shall\n\nbear substantially the following legend:\n\n\n\nThe shares of Capital Stock represented by this certificate are subject to\n\nrestrictions on Beneficial Ownership and Constructive Ownership and Transfer\n\nprimarily for the purpose of the Corporation\u0092s maintenance of its status as a\n\nreal estate investment trust (a \u0093REIT\u0094) under the Internal Revenue Code of\n\n1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094). Except as expressly provided in the\n\nCorporation\u0092s charter, (i) no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively\n\nOwn shares of Common Stock of the Corporation in excess of 9.8 percent (in\n\nvalue or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding\n\nCommon Stock of the Corporation unless such Person is an Excepted Holder (in\n\nwhich case the Excepted Holder Limit shall be applicable) or an Excluded\n\nHolder (in which case the Excluded Holder Limit shall be applicable); (ii)\n\nwith respect to any class or series of shares of Capital Stock other than\n\nCommon Stock, no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own more than\n\n9.8 percent (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of\n\nthe outstanding shares of such class or series of such stock of the\n\nCorporation (collectively, (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as the\n\n\u0093Ownership Limit\u0094), unless such Person is an Excepted\n\n\n\n-28- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nHolder (in which case the Excepted Holder Limit shall be applicable) or an\n\nExcluded Holder (in which case the Excluded Holder Limit shall be applicable);\n\n(iii) no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital\n\nStock that would result in the Corporation being \u0093closely held\u0094 under Section\n\n856(h) of the Code, would cause either the Corporation to be considered to\n\nConstructively Own an interest in a tenant that is described in Section\n\n856(d)(2)(B) of the Code for purposes of applying Section 856(c) of the Code\n\nor Host Marriott, L.P. (or any successor thereto) to be considered to\n\nConstructively Own an interest in a tenant that is described in Section\n\n856(d)(2)(B) of the Code for purposes of applying Section 7704(d) of the Code,\n\nor otherwise would cause the Corporation to fail to qualify as a REIT under\n\nthe Code; and (iv) no Person may Transfer shares of Capital Stock if such\n\nTransfer would result in shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation being\n\nowned by fewer than 100 Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, commencing at\n\n12:01 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the day immediately following the\n\neffective date of the merger (the \u0093Merger\u0094) of Host Marriott Corporation, a\n\nDelaware corporation, with and into the Corporation, no Excluded Holder shall\n\nBeneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of\n\nthe Excluded Holder Limit for such Excluded Holder. An \u0093Excepted Holder\u0094 means\n\na stockholder of the Corporation for whom an Excepted Holder Limit is created\n\nby the Board of Directors. An \u0093Excluded Holder\u0094 means any Person who acquires\n\nConstructive Ownership or Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock\n\nsolely by reason of the Transfer of Common Stock in the Merger and who,\n\nimmediately following the Merger, either Beneficially Owns or Constructively\n\nOwns shares of Common Stock in excess of the Ownership Limit solely by reason\n\nof the Transfer of Common Stock in the Merger. The \u0093Excluded Holder Limit\u0094\n\nmeans, with respect to any Excluded Holder, the lesser of (i) shares of\n\nCapital Stock representing 9.9% (in value) of the outstanding shares of\n\nCapital Stock of the Corporation or (ii) the shares of Capital Stock that such\n\nExcluded Holder was considered to Constructively Own immediately following the\n\nMerger solely by reason of the Merger (taking into account only such shares of\n\nCapital Stock and no other shares as to which such Person may thereafter\n\nbecome, for any reason, the Constructive Owner or the Beneficial Owner),\n\nprovided, however, that if at any\n\n\n\n-29- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\ntime the Excluded Holder Limit for any Excluded Holder would be less than the\n\nOwnership Limit, such Excluded Holder shall cease to be an Excluded Holder and\n\nthe Ownership Limit shall thereafter apply to such Person. Any Person who\n\nBeneficially Owns or Constructively Owns or attempts to Beneficially Own or\n\nConstructively Own shares of Capital Stock which cause or will cause a Person\n\nto Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess or\n\nin violation of the above limitations must immediately notify the Corporation.\n\nIf any of the restrictions on Transfer are violated, the shares of Capital\n\nStock represented hereby will be automatically transferred to a Charitable\n\nTrustee of a Charitable Trust for the benefit (except as otherwise provided in\n\nthe charter of the Corporation) of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries. In\n\naddition, upon the occurrence of certain events, attempted Transfers in\n\nviolation of the restrictions described above may be void ab initio. A Person\n\nwho attempts to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock\n\nin violation of the Transfer restrictions described above shall have no claim,\n\ncause of action or any recourse whatsoever against a transferor of such shares\n\nof Capital Stock. All capitalized terms in this legend have the meanings\n\ndefined in the Corporation\u0092s charter, as the same may be amended from time to\n\ntime, a copy of which, including the restrictions on Transfer, will be\n\nfurnished to each holder of shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation on\n\nrequest and without charge.\n\n\n\nInstead of the foregoing legend, the certificate may state that the\n\nCorporation will furnish a full statement about certain restrictions on\n\ntransferability to a stockholder on request and without charge.\n\n\n\nSection 8.3 Transfer of Shares of Capital Stock in the Corporation.\n\n\n\nSection 8.3.1 Ownership in Trust. Upon any purported Transfer or other event\n\ndescribed in Section 8.2.1(b) that would result in a transfer of shares of\n\nCapital Stock to a Charitable Trust, such shares of Capital Stock shall be\n\ndeemed to have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee as trustee of a\n\nCharitable Trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more Charitable\n\nBeneficiaries (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3.5). Such\n\ntransfer to the Charitable Trustee shall be deemed to be effective (i) as of\n\n12:01 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the Restriction Date, as to any Person\n\nwho Beneficially Owns or Constructively Owns shares of Capital Stock in\n\nviolation of Section 8.2.1(a)(i) or 8.2.1(a)(ii) or 8.2.1(a)(iii) as of such\n\ntime and date as a result of the Merger and the Transfer of shares of Capital\n\nStock to holders of shares of Host Marriott Corporation or (ii) as of the\n\nclose of business on the Business Day prior to\n\n\n\n-30- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nany other purported Transfer or other event that otherwise results in the\n\ntransfer to the Charitable Trust pursuant to Section 8.2.1(b) (or as of the\n\nclose of business on the Effective Date if such other purported Transfer or\n\nother event occurs on that date). The Charitable Trustee shall be appointed by\n\nthe Corporation and shall be a Person unaffiliated with the Corporation and\n\nany Prohibited Owner. Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be designated by the\n\nCorporation as provided in Section 8.3.7.\n\n\n\nSection 8.3.2 Status of Shares of Capital Stock Held by the Charitable\n\nTrustee. Shares of Capital Stock held by the Charitable Trustee shall be\n\nissued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation. The\n\nProhibited Owner shall have no rights in the shares of Capital Stock held by\n\nthe Charitable Trustee. The Prohibited Owner shall not benefit economically\n\nfrom ownership of any shares of Capital Stock held in trust by the Charitable\n\nTrustee (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3.5), shall have\n\nno rights to dividends or other distributions, and shall not possess any\n\nrights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares of Capital Stock\n\nheld in the Charitable Trust. The Prohibited Owner shall have no claim, cause\n\nof action or other recourse whatsoever against the purported transferor of\n\nsuch shares of Capital Stock.\n\n\n\nSection 8.3.3 Dividend and Voting Rights. The Charitable Trustee shall have\n\nall voting rights and rights to dividends or other distributions with respect\n\nto shares of Capital Stock held in the Charitable Trust, which rights shall be\n\nexercised for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary (except to\n\nthe extent otherwise provided in Section 8.3.5). Any dividend or other\n\ndistribution paid prior to the discovery by the Corporation that shares of\n\nCapital Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee shall be paid\n\nwith respect to such shares of Capital Stock to the Charitable Trustee upon\n\ndemand and any dividend or other distribution authorized but unpaid shall be\n\npaid when due to the Charitable Trustee. Any dividends or distributions so\n\npaid over to the Charitable Trustee shall be held in trust for the Charitable\n\nBeneficiary. The Prohibited Owner shall have no voting rights with respect to\n\nshares of Capital Stock held in the Charitable Trust and, subject to Maryland\n\nlaw, effective as of the date that shares of Capital Stock have been\n\ntransferred to the Charitable Trustee, the Charitable Trustee shall have the\n\nauthority (at the Charitable Trustee\u0092s sole discretion) (i) to rescind as void\n\nany vote cast by a Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery by the Corporation\n\nthat shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee\n\nand (ii) to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the Charitable\n\nTrustee acting for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary; provided,\n\nhowever, that if the Corporation has already taken irreversible action, then\n\nthe Charitable Trustee shall not have the power to rescind and recast such\n\nvote. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, until the\n\nCorporation has received notification that shares of Capital Stock have been\n\ntransferred into a Charitable Trust, the Corporation shall be entitled to rely\n\non its share transfer and other shareholder records for purposes of preparing\n\nlists of stockholders entitled to vote at meetings, determining the validity\n\nand authority of proxies, and otherwise conducting votes of stockholders.\n\n\n\nSection 8.3.4 Rights Upon Liquidation. Upon any voluntary or involuntary\n\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up of or any distribution of the assets of\n\n\n\n-31- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nthe Corporation, the Charitable Trustee shall be entitled to receive, ratably\n\nwith each other holder of shares of Capital Stock of the class or series of\n\nshares of Capital Stock that is held in the Charitable Trust, that portion of\n\nthe assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of\n\nsuch class or series (determined based upon the ratio that the number of\n\nshares of such class or series of shares of Capital Stock held by the\n\nCharitable Trustee bears to the total number of shares of Capital Stock of\n\nsuch class or series of shares of Capital Stock then outstanding). The\n\nCharitable Trustee shall distribute any such assets received in respect of the\n\nshares of Capital Stock held in the Charitable Trust in any liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up or distribution of the assets of the Corporation in\n\naccordance with Section 8.3.5.\n\n\n\nSection 8.3.5 Sale of Shares by Charitable Trustee.\n\n\n\n(a) Within 20 days of receiving notice from the Corporation that shares of\n\nCapital Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trust, the Charitable\n\nTrustee of the Charitable Trust shall sell the shares of Capital Stock held in\n\nthe Charitable Trust (together with the right to receive dividends or other\n\ndistributions with respect to such shares of Capital Stock as to any shares of\n\nCapital Stock transferred to the Charitable Trustee as a result of the\n\noperation of Section 8.2.1(b)) to a person, designated by the Charitable\n\nTrustee, whose ownership of the shares of Capital Stock will not violate the\n\nownership limitations set forth in Section 8.2.1(a).

If, prior to the discovery by the Corporation that shares of\n\nCapital Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee, such shares of\n\nCapital Stock are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then (i) such shares of Capital\n\nStock shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Charitable Trust and\n\n(ii) to the extent that the Prohibited Owner received an amount for such\n\nshares of Capital\n\n\n\n-32- \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nStock that exceeds the amount that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to\n\nreceive pursuant to this Section 8.3.5, such excess shall be paid to the\n\nCharitable Trustee upon demand.\n\n\n\nSection 8.3.6 Purchase Right in Shares of Capital Stock Transferred to the\n\nCharitable Trustee. Shares of Capital Stock transferred to the Charitable\n\nTrustee shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or\n\nits designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per\n\nshare in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Charitable\n\nTrust (or, in the case of a devise, gift or other such transaction, the Market\n\nPrice of the shares of Capital Stock on the day of the event causing the\n\nshares of Capital Stock to be held in the Charitable Trust) and (ii) the\n\nMarket Price on the date the Corporation, or its designee, accepts such offer.\n\nThe Corporation shall have the right to accept such offer until the Charitable\n\nTrustee has sold the shares of Capital Stock held in the Charitable Trust\n\npursuant to Section 8.3.5. Upon such a sale to the Corporation, the interest\n\nof the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares of Capital Stock sold shall\n\nterminate and the Charitable Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the\n\nsale to the Prohibited Owner.\n\n\n\nSection 8.3.7.
