In the event the Corporation shall at any\n\ntime after September 8, 1998 (the \"Rights Declaration Date\"), (i) declare any\n\ndividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the\n\noutstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a\n\nsmaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders\n\nof shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such\n\nevent under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by\n\nmultiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the\n\ndenominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n(2)   The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock as provided in paragraph (1) above immediately after it\n\ndeclares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend\n\npayable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or\n\ndistribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period\n\nbetween any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly\n\nDividend Payment Date, a dividend of $120 per share on the Series A Preferred\n\nStock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date.\n\n\n\n(3)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next\n\npreceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless\n\nthe date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first\n\nQuarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall\n\nbegin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of\n\nissue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date\n\nfor the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nentitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue\n\nand be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but\n\nunpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such\n\ndividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated\n\npro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time\n\noutstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the\n\ndetermination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to\n\nreceive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record\n\ndate shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment\n\nthereof.\n\n\n\n(b)  Voting Rights.\n\nThe holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following\n\nvoting rights:\n\n(1) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on\n\nall matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation.  In\n\nthe event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date\n\n(i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock,\n\n(ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding\n\nCommon Stock into a smaller number of votes per share to which holders of\n\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such\n\nevent shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the\n\nnumerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding\n\nimmediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n(2)Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Restated and Amended Charter,\n\nor under applicable law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and\n\nthe holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one voting group\n\non all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(3)  (i)  If at any time dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nshall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the\n\noccurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (a\n\n\"default period\") that shall extend until such time when all accrued and\n\nunpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the\n\ncurrent quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nthen outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment.\n\nDuring each default period, all holders of the outstanding shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock together with any other series of Preferred Stock then\n\nentitled to such a vote under the terms of the Restated and Amended Charter,\n\nvoting as a separate voting group, shall be entitled to elect two members of\n\nthe Board of Directors of the Corporation.\n\n   (ii)   During any default period, such voting right of the holders of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting\n\ncalled pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Subsection (b)(3) or at any\n\nannual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of\n\nstockholders, provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the\n\nholders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in\n\ncertain cases, the authorized number of Directors shall be exercised unless\n\nthe holders of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of Preferred Stock\n\noutstanding shall be present in person or by proxy.  The absence of a quorum\n\nof the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of\n\nPreferred Stock of such voting right.  At any meeting at which the holders of\n\nPreferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing\n\ndefault period, they shall have the right, voting as a separate voting group,\n\nto elect Directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors\n\nas may then exist up to two (2) Directors, or if such right is exercised at an\n\nannual meeting, to elect two (2) Directors.  If the number which may be so\n\nelected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the\n\nholders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in\n\nthe number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them\n\nof the required number.  After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have\n\nexercised their right to elect Directors in any default period and during the\n\ncontinuance of such period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or\n\ndecreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided\n\nor pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari\n\npassu with the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n    (iii)Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing\n\ndefault period, have previously exercised their right to elect Directors, the\n\nBoard of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the\n\naggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of\n\nPreferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling\n\nof a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall\n\nthereupon be called by the Chairman, President, a Vice-President or the\n\nSecretary of the Corporation.  Notice of such meeting and of any annual\n\nmeeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to\n\nthis paragraph (b)(3)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of\n\nPreferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as\n\nthe same appears on the books of the Corporation.  Such meeting shall be\n\ncalled for a time not earlier than 10 days and not later than 60 days after\n\nsuch order or request.  In the event such meeting is not called within 60 days\n\nafter such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by\n\nany stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten\n\npercent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii), no such special\n\nmeeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding\n\nthe date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.\n\n\n\n     (iv)    In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other\n\nclasses of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be\n\nentitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of Preferred\n\nStock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2) Directors voting as a\n\nseparate voting group, after the exercise of which right (x) the Directors so\n\nelected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their\n\nsuccessors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of\n\nthe default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except\n\nas provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)) be filled by vote of a majority of the\n\nremaining Directors theretofore elected by the voting group which elected the\n\nDirector whose office shall have become vacant.  References in this paragraph\n\n(b)(3)(iv) to Directors elected by a particular voting group shall include\n\nDirectors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause\n\n(y) of the foregoing sentence.\n\n\n\n    (v)    Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right\n\nof the holders of Preferred Stock, as a separate voting group, to elect\n\nDirectors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the holders of\n\nPreferred Stock, as a separate voting group, shall terminate, and (z) the\n\nnumber of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in, or\n\npursuant to, the Restated and Amended Charter or bylaws irrespective of any\n\nincrease made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) (such number\n\nbeing subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or\n\nin the Restated and Amended Charter or bylaws).  Any vacancies in the Board of\n\nDirectors affected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding\n\nsentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors, even though\n\nless than a quorum.\n\n\n\n(4)  Except as set forth herein or as otherwise provided in the Restated and\n\nAmended Charter, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special\n\nvoting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent\n\nthey are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein)\n\nfor taking any corporate action.\n\n\n\n(c)  Certain Restrictions.\n\n   (1)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions\n\npayable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Subsection (a) are in\n\narrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and\n\ndistributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\noutstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:\n\n\n\n(i) declare or pay or set apart for payment any dividends (other than\n\ndividends payable in shares of any class or classes of stock of the\n\nCorporation ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock) or make any other\n\ndistributions on, any class of stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either\n\nas to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series\n\nA Preferred Stock and shall not redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, whether voluntarily, for a sinking fund, or otherwise\n\nany shares of any class of stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as\n\nto dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation\n\nmay at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of stock of any\n\nsuch junior class in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds from the\n\nconcurrent sale of, other shares of stock of any such junior class;\n\n\n\n(ii)  declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any\n\nshares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon\n\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock,\n\nexcept dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such\n\nparity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the\n\ntotal amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;\n\n\n\n(iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any\n\nstock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that\n\nthe Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares\n\nof any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the\n\nCorporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution,\n\nliquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\n\n\n(iv)  purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or\n\nby publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of\n\nsuch shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of\n\nthe respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences\n\nof the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will\n\nresult in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.\n\n\n\n(2)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to\n\npurchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the\n\nCorporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (1) of Subsection\n\n(c), purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such\n\nmanner.\n\n\n\n(d)  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or\n\notherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be\n\nretired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All such shares\n\nshall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of\n\nPreferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock\n\nto be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject\n\nto the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.\n\n\n\n(e)   Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.\n\n(1)  Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up\n\nof the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of\n\nstock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution\n\nor winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the\n\nholders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $5.00 per\n\nshare, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions\n\nthereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the \"Series A\n\nLiquidation Preference\").  Following the payment of the full amount of the\n\nSeries A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to\n\nthe holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the\n\nholders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the\n\n\"Common Adjustment\") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series\n\nA Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth\n\nin subparagraph 3 below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock\n\ndividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number\n\nin clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as the \"Adjustment Number\").\n\nFollowing the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation\n\nPreference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their\n\nratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in\n\nthe ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Series A\n\nPreferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.\n\n\n\n(2)  In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to\n\npermit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the\n\nliquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, then\n\nsuch remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of all such\n\nshares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences.  In the\n\nevent, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit\n\npayment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be\n\ndistributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.\n\n\n\n(3)  In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights\n\nDeclaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of\n\nCommon Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine\n\nthe outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each\n\nsuch case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event\n\nshall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction, the\n\nnumerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding\n\nimmediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n(f)   Consolidation, Merger, Share Exchange, etc.  In case the Corporation\n\nshall enter into any consolidation, merger, share exchange, combination or\n\nother transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or\n\nchanged into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then\n\nin any such case the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time\n\nbe similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the\n\nprovision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the\n\naggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable\n\nin kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common\n\nStock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time\n\nafter the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock\n\npayable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common\n\nStock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of\n\nshares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence\n\nwith respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nshall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of\n\nwhich is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after\n\nsuch event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common\n\nStock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n(g)   Redemption.  The outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be\n\nredeemed at the option of the Board of Directors as a whole, but not in part,\n\nat any time, or from time to time, at a cash price per share equal to (i) 100%\n\nof the product of the Adjustment Number times the Average Market Value (as\n\nsuch term is hereinafter defined) of the Common Stock, plus (ii) all dividends\n\nwhich on the redemption date have accrued on the shares to be redeemed and\n\nhave not been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof\n\nset apart, without interest.  The \"Average Market Value\" is the average of the\n\nclosing sale prices of a share of the Common Stock during the 30-day period\n\nimmediately preceding the date before the redemption date on the Composite\n\nTape for New York Stock Exchange Listed Stocks, or, if such stock is not\n\nquoted on the Composite Tape, on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if such\n\nstock is not listed on such exchange, on the principal United States\n\nsecurities exchange registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\n\namended, on which such stock is listed, or, if such stock is not listed on any\n\nsuch exchange, the average of the closing bid quotations with respect to a\n\nshare of Common Stock during such 30-day period on the National Association of\n\nSecurities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System or any system then in use,\n\nor if no such quotations are available, the fair market value of a share of\n\nthe Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.\n\n\n\n(h)   Ranking.  The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity with any\n\nand all other series of Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the\n\ndistribution of assets.\n\n\n\n(i)   Amendment.  The Restated and Amended Charter shall not be further\n\namended in any manner that would adversely affect the preferences, rights or\n\npowers of the Series A Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of the\n\nholders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, if any, voting separately as one voting group.\n\n\n\n(j)   Fractional Shares.  Series A Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions\n\nof one one-thousandth of a share (and integral multiples thereof) which shall\n\nentitle the holder, in proportion to such holders' fractional shares, to\n\nexercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to\n\nhave the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\nPath: DOCSOPEN\\RICHMOND\\08322\\23797\\000296\\@@df03!.DOC\n\nDoc #: 480003; V. 3\n\nDoc Name: Restated and Amended Charter of Lowe's\n\n}Last Edit:1/31/00\n\n\n\nThis redlined draft, generated by CompareRite (TM) - The Instant Redliner,\n\nshows the differences between -\n\noriginal document   :\n\n\\\\RICS\\RICS\\DOCSOPEN\\RICHMOND\\08322\\23797\\000296\\@@DF01!.DOC\n\nand revised document: H:\\DOCSOPEN\\RICHMOND\\08322\\23797\\000296\\@@DF03!.DOC\n\n\n\nCompareRite found   29 change(s) in the text\n\n\n\nDeletions appear as Overstrike text surrounded by {}\n\nAdditions appear as Bold-Underline text surrounded by []\n\n\n\nG:jgray/Bd.Matters/Restated Articles/Restated Charter Final2\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n</TEXT>\n\n", "completion": {"answer": "Y", "reference": ["To the full extent that the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, as it exists on the date that this Amendment became effective, permits the elimination of the liability of Directors, a Director of the Company shall not be liable for monetary damages for breach of his duty as a Director.", "To the full extent that the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, as it exists on the date that this Amendment became effective, permits the elimination of the liability of Directors, a Director of the Company shall not be liable for monetary damages for breach of his duty as a Director.", "To the full extent that the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, as it exists on the date that this Amendment became effective, permits the elimination of the liability of Directors, a Director of the Company shall not be liable for monetary damages for breach of his duty as a Director."], "confidence": 5}, "ground_truth": "Y"}
