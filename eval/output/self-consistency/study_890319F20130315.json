Terms that are used and not otherwise defined in this Item\n\n(ii) have the meanings ascribed to them elsewhere in these Amended and\n\nRestated Articles of Incorporation or, if not so defined, their conventional\n\nmeanings.\n\n\n\n(a) There is hereby established a series of Preferred Stock designated \"Series\n\nB Non-Participating Convertible Preferred Stock,\" (the \"Series B Preferred\n\nStock\"), which shall initially consist of 40,000,000 authorized shares,\n\nsubject to one or more increases in the authorized shares of the series by a\n\nfurther amendment(s) to these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation\n\nto permit the issuance of additional shares upon the issuance of additional\n\nUnits (defined below) to Registered Unitholders (defined below) and to\n\naccommodate stock dividends or stock splits as provided below.\n\n\n\n(b) All shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased, exchanged, or otherwise\n\nacquired by the Corporation or that are converted into Common Stock shall be\n\nrestored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(c) Except upon the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the\n\nCorporation, the Series B Preferred Stock shall have no right to any assets of\n\nthe Corporation, and (except as expressly set forth in this Item (ii)) shall\n\nhave no right\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nto cash dividends or distributions (from whatever source), but shall have the\n\npreference rights upon dissolution, liquidation, and winding up that are set\n\nforth in this Item (ii) of this Section 2. The Series B Preferred Stock ranks\n\n(i) junior to any Parity Preferred Stock or Senior Preferred Stock (the Parity\n\nPreferred Stock and the Senior Preferred Stock are collectively referred to as\n\nthe \"Series B Senior Preferred Stock\"), (ii) pari passu with any other series\n\nof Preferred Stock hereafter duly established by the Board of Directors of the\n\nCorporation, the terms of which specifically provide that such series shall\n\nrank pari passu with the Series B Preferred Stock as to the distribution of\n\nassets upon liquidation (the \"Series B Parity Preferred Stock\"), and (iii)\n\nprior to any other class or series of Capital Stock, including, without\n\nlimitation, the Common Stock of the Corporation, whether now existing or\n\nhereafter created (collectively, the \"Series B Junior Stock\"). If shares of\n\nCommon Stock or other securities are distributed on the Common Stock or other\n\nvoting Capital Stock (as a stock dividend or otherwise) (a \"Voting Stock\n\nDividend\"), then each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall receive a\n\ndistribution of the number of shares (or warrants or rights to acquire shares,\n\nas the case may be) of Series B Preferred Stock that would then be necessary\n\nto preserve the relative voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock (i.e.,\n\nin relation to the voting power of all outstanding shares of voting Capital\n\nStock) that existed prior to the Voting Stock Dividend.\n\n\n\n(d) Subject to the rights of the Series B Senior Preferred Stock, upon any\n\nvoluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the\n\naffairs of the Corporation, and before any distribution of assets shall be\n\nmade in respect of any Series B Junior Stock, the holders of the Series B\n\nPreferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the\n\nCorporation legally available for distribution to its shareholders a\n\nliquidation preference of $0.001 per share in cash (or property having a fair\n\nmarket value as determined by the Board of Directors valued at $0.001 per\n\nshare). After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to\n\nwhich they are entitled, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no\n\nright or claims to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(e) The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and shall not be\n\nsubject to redemption; however, the foregoing shall not be a restriction on\n\nthe Corporation's otherwise lawful redemption of shares of Series B Preferred\n\nStock on a consensual basis with each holder of the shares to be redeemed.\n\n\n\n(f) (1) The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, and will be automatically\n\nconverted under the circumstances described below, into Common Stock at a\n\nconversion ratio of 14,000:1; i.e., each 14,000 shares of Series B Preferred\n\nStock may be converted into one share of Common Stock. In lieu of issuing less\n\nthan a full share (a \"fractional share\") of Common Stock upon the conversion\n\nof fewer than 14,000 shares (or an integral multiple of 14,000 shares) of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall redeem the shares of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock that would otherwise be convertible into a fractional share of\n\nCommon Stock (the \"Scrip Shares\"), and from and after the date of the\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nconversion, the Scrip Shares shall cease to be outstanding shares of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock, shall not constitute any other class of Capital Stock, and\n\nshall entitle the holder only to receive the cash redemption price, as\n\nprovided below.\n\n\n\n(2) The Corporation will initially issue the Series B Preferred Stock to each\n\nPerson who, on the initial date of issuance, is a Registered Unitholder at the\n\nrate of one share for each Unit held by such Registered Unitholder, if such\n\nRegistered Unitholder subscribes for the shares and pays to the Corporation an\n\namount equal to the product of $0.001 multiplied by the number of shares of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock to be issued to him. Shares of Series B Preferred\n\nStock may be issued only in certificated, fully registered form and may be\n\nissued only to Registered Unitholders. The Corporation may issue fractional\n\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock. Following the initial issuance of the\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock, each Registered Unitholder acquiring one or more\n\nnewly issued Units shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation shares of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock equal in number to the number of newly issued Units\n\nacquired by such Registered Unitholder, provided that the Registered\n\nUnitholder subscribes for the shares and pays to the Corporation an amount\n\nequal to the product of $0.001 multiplied by the number of shares of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock to be issued to him. Except as provided below, a holder of\n\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock may freely effect a transfer of the shares\n\nto any Person (subject to the Transfer being in compliance with, or (to the\n\nsatisfaction of the Corporation) exempt from, applicable securities laws and\n\nregulations). Upon a Registered Unitholder's Transfer of one or more Units to\n\nanother Registered Unitholder, then (to the extent of the transferring\n\nRegistered Unitholder's then ownership of Series B Preferred Stock) the\n\ntransferring Registered Unitholder shall be deemed to have transferred to the\n\ntransferee of the Units (i) shares of Series B Preferred Stock equal in number\n\nto the number of transferred Units or if, after giving effect to the Unit\n\nTransfer, the transferring Registered Unitholder will cease to own any Units,\n\n(ii) all of the transferring Registered Unitholder's shares of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Registered Unitholder shall\n\nhave the right (which shall be exercised by delivering written notice at the\n\ntime of the Unit Transfer to the Corporation and the transferee of the Units)\n\nto negate the deemed simultaneous Transfer of Series B Preferred Stock. A\n\nRegistered Unitholder desiring to sell (by exchange or otherwise) Units to the\n\nCorporation shall be required to surrender to the Corporation for conversion\n\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock equal in number to the number of Units\n\nbeing sold (by exchange or otherwise), but only if and to the extent that,\n\nafter giving effect to the Corporation's proposed purchase of Units, the\n\nnumber of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will exceed the\n\naggregate number of Units held by all Registered Unitholders. Shares of Series\n\nB Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion as provided in the immediately\n\npreceding sentence shall be converted into Common Stock, as provided in\n\nsubparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (f), upon the Corporation's purchase of the\n\nUnits of the surrendering Registered Unitholder, and the Corporation shall\n\npromptly redeem any resulting Scrip Shares for cash, as provided below. Except\n\nas provided above in this subparagraph (f)(2), a holder of\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock shall have no voluntary conversion rights with\n\nrespect to the Series B Preferred Stock, but shares of Series B Preferred\n\nStock shall automatically convert into Common Stock as provided in\n\nsubparagraph (3) of this Paragraph (f).\n\n\n\n(3) After giving effect to a Transfer of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to\n\na Registered Unitholder, the transferee Registered Unitholder is permitted to\n\nown shares of Series B Preferred Stock up to (i) the number of Units then\n\nowned by such transferee Registered Unitholder or (ii) 5% of the outstanding\n\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock, whichever is greater (any shares in excess\n\nof a transferee Registered Unitholder's permitted ownership of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock are referred to as the \"Disproportionate Shares\"). After\n\ngiving effect to a Transfer of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to any\n\nPerson who is not a Registered Unitholder, the transferee is permitted to own\n\nup to 5% of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (any shares\n\nheld by a transferee of Series B Preferred Stock who is not a Registered\n\nUnitholder in excess of such 5% limit are referred to as the \"Greater than 5%\n\nShares\"). Upon a Transfer of Series B Preferred Stock resulting in the\n\ntransferee holding Disproportionate Shares or Greater than 5% Shares, as\n\napplicable, the Disproportionate Shares or Greater than 5% Shares, as\n\napplicable, shall automatically convert into Common Stock as provided in\n\nsubparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (f) without action on the part of anyone,\n\nand the Corporation shall promptly redeem any resulting Scrip Shares for cash,\n\nas provided below. Upon any such automatic conversion, each certificate\n\nevidencing converted shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall instead\n\nrepresent the whole number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock were converted and the right to receive the cash\n\nredemption payment for any Scrip Shares evidenced by such certificate until\n\nsuch certificate is surrendered to the Corporation for cancellation in\n\nexchange for a Common Stock certificate and the redemption price of the Scrip\n\nShares (if any).\n\n\n\n(4) Upon conversion of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock, no payment or\n\nadjustment shall be made on account of dividends declared and payable to\n\nholders of Common Stock of record on a date prior to the date of conversion.\n\n\n\n(5) As soon as practicable on or after the date of conversion of shares of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock and the surrender to the Corporation of the\n\ncertificate(s) evidencing the converted shares, the Corporation will issue and\n\ndeliver to or at the direction of the converting shareholder a certificate(s)\n\nfor the whole number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.\n\nThe Corporation shall redeem Scrip Shares resulting from a voluntary or\n\nautomatic conversion of Series B Preferred Stock for a cash payment equal to\n\nthe fair value of the fractional share of Common Stock into which the Scrip\n\nShares would otherwise be convertible (the fair value shall be the product of\n\nthe relevant fraction multiplied by the closing price of the Common Stock on\n\nthe trading date next preceding the date of conversion on the principal\n\nnational securities\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nexchange on which the Common Stock is listed (or the average of the high and\n\nlow prices of the Common Stock on such date on the principal national market\n\nsystem on which the Common Stock is traded) or (if the Common Stock is not so\n\nlisted or traded) the fair value of the Common Stock on such date as\n\ndetermined by the Corporation's Board of Directors). The Corporation shall be\n\nresponsible for any stamp or other issuance taxes payable upon the issuance of\n\nCommon Stock in exchange for surrendered or automatically converted shares of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(g) (1) On all matters with respect to which shareholders of the Corporation\n\nvote, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote. On\n\nall matters with respect to which the Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to\n\nvote as a separate class, including the nomination of directors pursuant to\n\nsubparagraph (2) of this Paragraph (g), the action shall be determined by the\n\nvote (which may be by non-unanimous written consent) of a majority of the\n\noutstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to vote. On all other\n\nmatters, including the election of directors, the Series B Preferred Stock\n\nwill vote as a single class with all other Capital Stock entitled to vote.\n\n\n\n(2) With respect to each annual meeting of the Corporation's shareholders,\n\ncommencing with the annual meeting of the Corporation's shareholders to be\n\nheld in 1999 (the \"1999 Annual Meeting\"), the holders of shares of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock shall have the right, voting as a separate class, to designate\n\nnominees for election as directors of the Corporation and to have such\n\nnominees included as such in the Corporation's proxy statement and ballots\n\n(or, if none, in a specially prepared proxy statement and ballots) submitted\n\nto the shareholders of the Corporation entitled to vote in a timely manner\n\nprior to the annual meeting. The Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts,\n\nconsistent with the Board of Directors' exercise of its fiduciary duties, to\n\ncause the election of the nominees designated by the holders of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock. With respect to the 1999 Annual Meeting, the holders of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock shall have the right to designate four nominees. With\n\nrespect to each succeeding annual meeting of shareholders, the number of\n\nnominees to be designated by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock (the\n\n\"Base Number of Series B Nominees\") shall be equal to the difference between\n\n(i) four and (ii) the number of directors whose terms commenced prior to and\n\nwill continue after such meeting and who were nominated to serve such terms by\n\nthe holders of Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. The Base\n\nNumber of Series B Nominees calculated as set forth in the immediately\n\npreceding sentence shall be reduced (i) by one, if as of the record date for\n\ndetermining the shareholders entitled to vote for the election of directors at\n\nthe relevant annual meeting (the \"Record Date\"), the Registered Unitholders\n\ncollectively own less than 25% (but at least 15%) of the Fully Diluted Common\n\nStock of the Corporation, (ii) by two, if as of the Record Date, the\n\nRegistered Unitholders collectively own less than 15% (but at least 10%) of\n\nthe Fully Diluted Common Stock of the Corporation, (iii) by three, if as of\n\nthe Record Date, the Registered Unitholders collectively own less than 10%\n\n(but at least 5%)\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nof the Fully Diluted Common Stock of the Corporation, and (iv) to zero, if as\n\nof the Record Date, the Registered Unitholders collectively own less than 5%\n\nof the Fully Diluted Common Stock of the Corporation. For purposes of the\n\nimmediately preceding sentence, (i) \"Fully Diluted Common Stock of the\n\nCorporation\" means all shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the\n\nrelevant Record Date, plus all shares of Common Stock issuable upon the\n\nexercise of vested employee stock options to acquire Common Stock and issuable\n\nupon the exchange of Units owned by the Registered Unitholders (assuming a 1:1\n\nexchange ratio and calculated without regard to limitations imposed on the\n\nability or rights of certain Registered Unitholders to exchange Units for\n\nCommon Stock), and (ii) the Registered Unitholders shall be deemed to\n\n\"collectively own\" all shares of Common Stock that they own in fact, that they\n\nhave the right to acquire upon the exercise of vested employee stock options,\n\nand that would be issued upon the exchange (without regard to limitations\n\nimposed on the ability or rights of certain Registered Unitholders to exchange\n\nUnits for Common Stock) of all outstanding Units (and Units issuable upon the\n\nexercise of options to acquire Units) held by the Registered Unitholders.\n\n\n\n(h) At all times when the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a\n\nseparate class, are entitled to designate nominees for election as directors\n\nof the Corporation, (i) the Board of Directors shall consist of nine directors\n\n(other than during any vacancy caused by the death, resignation, or removal of\n\na director), plus the number of directors that any series of Preferred Stock,\n\nvoting separately as a class, has the right to elect because of the\n\nCorporation's default in the payment of preferential dividends due on such\n\nseries, and (ii) a majority of the directors shall be \"independent\" (for these\n\npurposes, an individual shall be deemed \"independent\" if such individual is\n\nneither an officer nor an employee of the Corporation or any of its direct or\n\nindirect subsidiaries). At such time as the holders of Series B Preferred\n\nStock no longer have the right to designate any nominees for election as\n\ndirectors of the Corporation, the size of the Board of Directors shall be as\n\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws of the\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n(i) For purposes of this Item (ii) of this Subsection (c) of this Section 2 of\n\nthis Article III, the following terms have the indicated meanings:\n\n\n\n(1) \"Registered Unitholder\" means a Person, other than the Corporation, (i)\n\nwho at the relevant time is reflected in the records of The Taubman Realty\n\nGroup Limited Partnership as a partner in such partnership (or who as the\n\nresult of a Transfer of Units is being admitted as a partner in such\n\npartnership) or (ii) who is (or upon completion of the relevant Transfer\n\n(including, for these purposes, the exercise of an option to acquire a Unit)\n\nwill become) a beneficial owner of Units.\n\n\n\n(2) \"Units\" means Units of Partnership Interest in The Taubman Realty Group\n\nLimited Partnership (and its successors), and any\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nsecurities into which such Units of Partnership Interest (as a class) are\n\nconverted or for which such Units (as a class) are exchanged, whether by\n\nmerger, reclassification, or otherwise.

The\n\nfirst dividend may be for less than a full quarter. All dividends on the\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock, including any dividend for any partial dividend\n\nperiod, shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve\n\n30-day months. Dividends will be payable to holders of record as they appear\n\nin the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on the\n\napplicable record date, which shall be the 15th day of the calendar month in\n\nwhich the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls or on such other date\n\ndesigned by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for the payment of\n\ndividends that is not more than 30 nor less than ten days prior to such\n\nDividend Payment Date (each, a \"Dividend Record Date\").\n\n\n\n(2) No dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock shall be declared by the\n\nBoard of Directors or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such\n\ntime as any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to\n\nits indebtedness, prohibits such declaration, payment, or setting apart for\n\npayment or provides that such declaration, payment, or setting apart for\n\npayment would constitute a breach of, or a default under, such agreement or if\n\nsuch declaration, payment, or setting aside shall be restricted or prohibited\n\nby law.\n\n\n\n(3) Dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock shall accrue and be cumulative\n\nregardless of whether the Corporation has earnings, regardless of whether\n\nthere are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends, and\n\nregardless of whether such dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid\n\ndividends on the Series F Preferred Stock will accumulate as of the Dividend\n\nPayment Date on which they first become payable. Except as set forth below in\n\nthis Subparagraph (3), no dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for\n\npayment on any Common Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock ranking, as\n\nto dividends, on a parity with or junior to the Series F Preferred Stock\n\n(other than a dividend in shares of Junior Stock) for any period unless full\n\ncumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or\n\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such\n\npayment on the Series F Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the\n\nthen current dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full (and a sum\n\nsufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking\n\non a parity as to dividends with the Series F Preferred Stock, all dividends\n\ndeclared upon the Series F Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred\n\nStock ranking on a parity as to\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\ndividends with the Series F Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata, so\n\nthat the amount of dividends declared per share of Series F Preferred Stock\n\nand such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other\n\nthe same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the Series F Preferred\n\nStock and such other series of Preferred Stock (which shall not include any\n\naccrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such\n\nPreferred Stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No\n\ninterest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock that may be in arrears. Holders of shares of the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable in\n\ncash, property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends on the Series\n\nF Preferred Stock as provided above. Any dividend payment made on shares of\n\nthe Series F Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest\n\naccumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares that remains\n\npayable.\n\n\n\n(4) Except as provided in Subparagraph (3) of this Paragraph (d) of this Item\n\n(v) of this Subsection (c) of this Section 2 of this Article III, unless full\n\ncumulative dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock have been or\n\ncontemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for\n\nthe payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and\n\nthe then current dividend period: (i) no dividends (other than in shares of\n\nJunior Stock) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any\n\nother distribution be declared or made upon the Common Stock and the Series B\n\nPreferred Stock (or any other Preferred Stock ranking junior to or on a parity\n\nwith the Series F Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation); and\n\n(ii) no shares of Common Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock (or any other\n\nPreferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation) shall be\n\nredeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (nor shall\n\nany moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption\n\nof any such shares) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange\n\nfor Junior Stock).\n\n\n\n(5) If for any taxable year the Corporation elects to designate as \"capital\n\ngains dividends\" (as defined in Section 857 of the Code) any portion (the\n\n\"Capital Gains Amount\") of the dividends paid or made available for the year\n\nto holders of all classes of Capital Stock (the \"Total Dividends\"), then the\n\nportion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to the holders of\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock shall be the amount that the total dividends paid or\n\nmade available to the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock for the year\n\nbears to the Total Dividends.\n\n\n\n(6) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Corporation\n\nmay declare and pay a dividend on the Common Stock, without preserving the\n\npriority of distributions described in Subparagraphs 3 and 4 of this Paragraph\n\n(d) of this Item (v) of this Subsection (c) of this Section 2 of this Article\n\nIII, but only to the extent such dividends are required to preserve the Real\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nEstate Investment Trust status of the Corporation and to avoid the imposition\n\nof an excise tax on the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(e) Subject to the rights of any Senior Preferred Stock, upon any voluntary or\n\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the\n\nCorporation, and before any distribution of assets shall be made in respect of\n\nany Junior Stock, the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock shall be\n\nentitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for\n\ndistribution to its shareholders a liquidation preference of $100 per share in\n\ncash (or property having a fair market value as determined by the Board of\n\nDirectors valued at $100 per share), plus an amount equal to any accrued but\n\nunpaid dividends to the date of payment. After payment of the full amount of\n\nthe liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock shall have no right or claims to any of the remaining\n\nassets of the Corporation. Neither the consolidation or merger of the\n\nCorporation with or into any other corporation, trust, or entity (or of any\n\nother corporation with or into the Corporation) nor the sale, lease, or\n\nconveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the\n\nCorporation shall be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or\n\nwinding up of the Corporation for the purpose of this Paragraph (e) of this\n\nItem (v).\n\n\n\n(f) (1) The Series F Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to May 27, 2009.\n\nOn and after May 27, 2009, the Corporation, at its option upon not less than\n\n30 nor more than 60 days\u0092 written notice, may redeem shares of the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for a\n\ncash redemption price of $100 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends\n\nto the date fixed for redemption (except as provided below).\n\n\n\n(2) Holders of Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender such\n\nshares at the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be\n\nentitled to the redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends payable\n\nupon such redemption following such surrender. If notice of redemption has\n\nbeen given and if the Corporation has set aside in trust the funds necessary\n\nfor the redemption, then from and after the redemption date: (i) dividends\n\nshall cease to accrue on such shares of Series F Preferred Stock; (ii) such\n\nshares of Series F Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding; and\n\n(iii) all rights of the holders of such shares shall terminate, except the\n\nright to receive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series F Preferred Stock to be\n\nredeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without\n\ncreating fractional shares) or by any other equitable method determined by the\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n(3) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series F Preferred Stock\n\nshall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a\n\nsum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment, no shares of\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nshall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock (except by exchange for Junior Stock); however, the\n\nforegoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series F\n\nPreferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same\n\nterms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(4) Notice of redemption shall be mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid,\n\nnot less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed\n\nto the respective holders of record of the Series F Preferred Stock to be\n\nredeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the stock transfer\n\nrecords of the Corporation. No failure to give or defect in such notice shall\n\naffect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective\n\nor not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the\n\nredemption price; (iii) the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be\n\nredeemed; (iv) the place or places where the Series F Preferred Stock is to be\n\nsurrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the\n\nshares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date. If fewer\n\nthan all shares of the Series F Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be\n\nredeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of\n\nshares of Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.\n\n\n\n(5) The holders of Series F Preferred Stock at the close of business on a\n\nDividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable with\n\nrespect to such Series F Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment\n\nDate notwithstanding the redemption thereof between such Dividend Record Date\n\nand the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or the Corporation\u0092s default in\n\nthe payment of the dividend due. Except as provided above, the Corporation\n\nwill make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, regardless of whether\n\nin arrears, on called Series F Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(6) The Series F Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and no sinking fund\n\nshall be required and shall not be subject to mandatory redemption. The Series\n\nF Preferred Stock is not convertible into any other securities of the\n\nCorporation, but is subject to the Excess Stock (and all other) provisions of\n\nthis Article III.\n\n\n\n(g) (1) Except as may be required by law or as otherwise expressly provided in\n\nthis Item (v) of this Subsection (c) of this Section 2 of this Article III,\n\nthe holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote. On all\n\nmatters with respect to which the Series F Preferred Stock is entitled to\n\nvote, each share of Series F Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote.\n\n\n\n(2) Whenever dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock are in arrears (which\n\nshall, with respect to any quarterly dividend, mean that any such divided has\n\nnot been paid in full whether or not earned or declared) for six or more\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nquarterly periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors then\n\nconstituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the holders\n\nof Series F Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other\n\nseries of Voting Parity Preferred) shall have the right to elect two directors\n\nof the Corporation at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at\n\nleast 10% of the Series F Preferred Stock or at least 10% of any other Voting\n\nParity Preferred so in arrears (unless such request is received less than 90\n\ndays before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the\n\nshareholders) or at the next annual meeting of shareholders, and at each\n\nsubsequent annual meeting, until all dividends accumulated on the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the then current dividend\n\nperiod have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment\n\nof such dividends has been set aside for payment. If and when all accumulated\n\ndividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series\n\nF Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for payment in\n\nfull, the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock shall be divested of the\n\nforegoing voting rights (but subject always to the same provision for the\n\nvesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in\n\nsix quarterly dividends), and if all accumulated dividends and the dividend\n\nfor the then current period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in\n\nfull on all series of Voting Parity Preferred, the term of office of each\n\ndirector so elected by the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock and the\n\nVoting Parity Preferred shall terminate.\n\n\n\n(3) As long as any shares of Series F Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the\n\nCorporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders\n\nof at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock\n\n(voting as a separate class); (i) authorize or create, or increase the\n\nauthorized or issued amount of, any Capital Stock ranking senior to the Series\n\nF Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution\n\nof assets upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up or reclassify any\n\nauthorized Capital Stock of the Corporation into or exchangeable for such\n\nshares, or create, authorize, or issue any obligation or security convertible\n\ninto or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares; or (ii) amend,\n\nalter, or repeal the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of\n\nIncorporation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise (an \"Event\"), so\n\nas to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege, or\n\nvoting power of the Series F Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; however,\n\nas long as the Series F Preferred Stock remains outstanding with its terms\n\nmaterially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of an\n\nEvent, the Corporation may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of an\n\nEvent described in clause (ii) above of this Subparagraph (3) shall not be\n\ndeemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences,\n\nprivileges, or voting power of the holders of Series F Preferred Stock, and\n\n(x) any increase in the amount of the authorized Preferred Stock or the\n\ncreation or issuance of any other series of Preferred Stock, or (y) any\n\nincrease in the amount of authorized shares of the Series F Preferred Stock or\n\nany other series of Preferred Stock, in the case of either (x) or (y) ranking\n\non a parity with or junior to the Series F Preferred Stock with respect to\n\npayment of dividends or the\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\ndistribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, shall not\n\nbe deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences,\n\nprivileges, or voting powers.\n\n\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Series F Preferred Stock shall not be\n\nentitled to vote, and the foregoing voting provisions shall not apply, if at\n\nor prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would\n\notherwise be required is effected, all outstanding shares of the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock have been redeemed or called for redemption, and sufficient\n\nfunds have been deposited in trust for the benefit of the holders of the\n\nSeries F Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.\n\n\n\n(vi) Series G Preferred Stock. Subject in all cases to the other provisions of\n\nthis Section 2 of this Article III, including, without limitation, those\n\nprovisions restricting the Beneficial Ownership and Constructive Ownership of\n\nshares of Capital Stock and those provisions with respect to Excess Stock, the\n\nfollowing sets forth the designation, preferences, limitations as to\n\ndividends, voting and other rights, and the terms and conditions of redemption\n\nof the Series G Preferred Stock (defined below) of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(a) There is hereby established a series of Preferred Stock designated \"8%\n\nSeries G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock\" (the \"Series G Preferred\n\nStock\"), which shall consist of 4,000,000 authorized shares.\n\n\n\n(b) All shares of Series G Preferred Stock redeemed, purchased, exchanged, or\n\notherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of\n\nauthorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(c) The Series G Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend rights and\n\nrights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution, rank (i) junior to any\n\nother series of Preferred Stock hereafter duly established by the Board of\n\nDirectors of the Corporation, the terms of which specifically provide that\n\nsuch series shall rank prior to the Series G Preferred Stock as to the payment\n\nof dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation, winding up or\n\ndissolution (the \"Senior Preferred Stock\"), (ii) pari passu with the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock hereafter duly\n\nestablished by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the terms of which\n\nspecifically provide that such series shall rank pari passu with the Series G\n\nPreferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon\n\nliquidation, winding up or dissolution (the \"Parity Preferred Stock\"), and\n\n(iii) prior to the Common Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and any other\n\nclass or series of Capital Stock, the terms of which specifically provide that\n\nsuch class or series of Capital Stock shall rank junior to the Series G\n\nPreferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon\n\nliquidation, winding up or dissolution, whether now existing or hereafter\n\ncreated (collectively, the \"Junior Stock\").\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(d) (1) Subject to the rights of any Senior Preferred Stock, the holders of\n\nthe then outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall be entitled to\n\nreceive, as and when declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally\n\navailable for the payment of dividends, cumulative preferential cash dividends\n\nat the annual rate of 8% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (i.e.,\n\n$2.00 per annum per share). Such dividends shall accrue and be cumulative from\n\nthe date of original issue and shall be payable in equal quarterly amounts in\n\narrears on or about the last day of each March, June, September, and December\n\nor, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business day with\n\nthe same force and effect as if made on such date (each, a \"Dividend Payment\n\nDate\") (for the purposes of this Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph (d), a\n\n\"business day\" is any day, other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, on\n\nwhich banks in Detroit, Michigan, are open for business). The first dividend,\n\nwhich shall be paid on December 31, 2004, will be for less than a full\n\nquarter. All dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock, including any dividend\n\nfor any partial dividend period, shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day\n\nyear consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends will be payable to holders\n\nof record as they appear in the stock records of the Corporation at the close\n\nof business on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th day of the\n\ncalendar month in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls or on such\n\nother date designed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for the\n\npayment of dividends that is not more than 30 nor less than ten days prior to\n\nsuch Dividend Payment Date (each, a \"Dividend Record Date\").\n\n\n\n(2) No dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock shall be declared by the\n\nBoard of Directors or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such\n\ntime as any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to\n\nits indebtedness, prohibits such declaration, payment, or setting apart for\n\npayment or provides that such declaration, payment, or setting apart for\n\npayment would constitute a breach of, or a default under, such agreement or if\n\nsuch declaration, payment, or setting aside shall be restricted or prohibited\n\nby law.\n\n\n\n(3) Dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock shall accrue and be cumulative\n\nregardless of whether the Corporation has earnings, regardless of whether\n\nthere are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends, and\n\nregardless of whether such dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid\n\ndividends on the Series G Preferred Stock will accumulate as of the Dividend\n\nPayment Date on which they first become payable. Except as provided in this\n\nSubparagraph (3), unless full cumulative dividends on the Series G Preferred\n\nStock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a\n\nsum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past\n\ndividend periods and the then current dividend period: (i) no dividends (other\n\nthan in shares of Junior Stock) shall be declared by the Board of Directors or\n\npaid or set aside for payment nor shall any other distribution be declared or\n\nmade upon the Common Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock or any other class or series\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nof Capital Stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series G Preferred\n\nStock as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, winding up or\n\ndissolution; and (ii) no shares of Common Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock,\n\nthe Series F Preferred Stock or any other class or series of Capital Stock\n\nranking junior to or on a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock as to\n\ndividend rights and rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution shall\n\nbe redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (nor shall\n\nany moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption\n\nof any such shares) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange\n\nfor Junior Stock). When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient\n\nfor such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series G Preferred Stock\n\nand the shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as\n\nto dividends with the Series G Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon\n\nthe Series G Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking\n\non a parity as to dividends with the Series G Preferred Stock shall be\n\ndeclared pro rata, so that the amount of dividends declared per share of\n\nSeries G Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all\n\ncases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on\n\nthe Series G Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock (which\n\nshall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior\n\ndividend periods if such Preferred Stock does not have a cumulative dividend)\n\nbear to each other. No interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend\n\npayment on the Series G Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. Holders of\n\nshares of the Series G Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend,\n\nwhether payable in cash, property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative\n\ndividends on the Series G Preferred Stock as provided above. Any dividend\n\npayment made on shares of the Series G Preferred Stock shall first be credited\n\nagainst the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to such\n\nshares that remains payable.\n\n\n\n(4) If for any taxable year the Corporation elects to designate as \"capital\n\ngains dividends\" (as defined in Section 857 of the Code) any portion (the\n\n\"Capital Gains Amount\") of the dividends paid or made available for the year\n\nto holders of all classes of Capital Stock (the \"Total Dividends\"), then the\n\nportion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to the holders of\n\nSeries G Preferred Stock shall be the amount that the total dividends paid or\n\nmade available to the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock for the year\n\nbears to the Total Dividends.\n\n\n\n(e) Subject to the rights of any Senior Preferred Stock, upon any voluntary or\n\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the\n\nCorporation, and before any distribution of assets shall be made in respect of\n\nany Junior Stock, the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock shall be\n\nentitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for\n\ndistribution to its shareholders a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share\n\nin cash (or property having a fair market value as determined by the Board of\n\nDirectors valued at $25.00 per share), plus an amount equal to any accrued but\n\nunpaid dividends to the date of payment. After payment of the full amount of\n\nthe liquidating\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\ndistributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series G Preferred\n\nStock shall have no right or claims to any of the remaining assets of the\n\nCorporation. In the event that, upon such voluntary or involuntary\n\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, the\n\navailable assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the\n\nliquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred\n\nStock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of Parity Preferred\n\nStock, then the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred\n\nStock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to\n\nthe full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be\n\nrespectively entitled. Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation\n\nwith or into any other corporation, trust, or entity (or of any other\n\ncorporation with or into the Corporation) nor the sale, lease, or conveyance\n\nof all or substantially all of the property or business of the Corporation\n\nshall be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the\n\nCorporation for the purpose of this Paragraph (e) of this Item (vi). Written\n\nnotice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,\n\nstating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the\n\namounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given\n\nby first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\n\nprior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of shares of\n\nSeries G Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the\n\nsame shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(f) (1) The Series G Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to November 23,\n\n2009. On and after November 23, 2009, the Corporation, at its option upon not\n\nless than 30 nor more than 60 days\u0092 written notice, may redeem shares of the\n\nSeries G Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to\n\ntime, for a cash redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and\n\nunpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption (except as provided below).\n\n\n\n(2) Holders of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender such\n\nshares at the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be\n\nentitled to the redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends payable\n\nupon such redemption following such surrender. If notice of redemption has\n\nbeen given and if the Corporation has set aside in trust the funds necessary\n\nfor the redemption for the benefit of the holders of the Series G Preferred\n\nStock called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date: (i)\n\ndividends shall cease to accrue on such shares of Series G Preferred Stock;\n\n(ii) such shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed\n\noutstanding; and (iii) all rights of the holders of such shares shall\n\nterminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. If less than all\n\nof the outstanding Series G Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series G\n\nPreferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be\n\npracticable without creating fractional shares) or by any other equitable\n\nmethod determined by the Corporation.\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(3) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series G Preferred Stock\n\nshall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a\n\nsum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past\n\ndividend periods and the then current dividend period, no shares of Series G\n\nPreferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series G\n\nPreferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not\n\npurchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series G\n\nPreferred Stock or any class or series of Capital Stock ranking junior to or\n\non a parity with the Series G Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and\n\ndistribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the\n\nCorporation (except by exchange for Junior Stock); however, the foregoing\n\nshall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series G Preferred\n\nStock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to\n\nholders of all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(4) Notice of redemption shall be mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid,\n\nnot less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed\n\nto the respective holders of record of the Series G Preferred Stock to be\n\nredeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the stock transfer\n\nrecords of the Corporation. No failure to give or defect in such notice shall\n\naffect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of\n\nSeries G Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective\n\nor not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the\n\nredemption price and accrued and unpaid dividends payable on the redemption\n\ndate; (iii) the number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed;\n\n(iv) the place or places where the Series G Preferred Stock is to be\n\nsurrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the\n\nshares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date. If fewer\n\nthan all shares of the Series G Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be\n\nredeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of\n\nshares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.\n\n\n\n(5) The holders of Series G Preferred Stock at the close of business on a\n\nDividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable with\n\nrespect to such Series G Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment\n\nDate notwithstanding the redemption thereof between such Dividend Record Date\n\nand the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or the Corporation\u0092s default in\n\nthe payment of the dividend due. Except as provided above, the Corporation\n\nwill make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, regardless of whether\n\nin arrears, on called Series G Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(6) The Series G Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and shall not be\n\nsubject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption. The Series G Preferred\n\nStock is not convertible into any other securities of the Corporation, but is\n\nsubject to the Excess Stock (and all other) provisions of this Article III.\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(g) (1) Except as may be required by law or as otherwise expressly provided in\n\nthis Item (vi) of this Subsection (c) of this Section 2 of this Article III,\n\nthe holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote. On all\n\nmatters with respect to which the Series G Preferred Stock is entitled to\n\nvote, each share of Series G Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote.\n\n\n\n(2) Whenever dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock are in arrears (which\n\nshall, with respect to any quarterly dividend, mean that any such dividend has\n\nnot been paid in full whether or not earned or declared) for six or more\n\nquarterly periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors then\n\nconstituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the holders\n\nof Series G Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other\n\nseries of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred\n\nand are exercisable (\u0093Voting Parity Preferred\u0094)) shall have the right to elect\n\ntwo directors of the Corporation at a special meeting called by the holders of\n\nrecord of at least 10% of the Series G Preferred Stock or at least 10% of any\n\nother Voting Parity Preferred so in arrears (unless such request is received\n\nless than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting\n\nof the shareholders) or at the next annual meeting of shareholders, and at\n\neach subsequent annual meeting, until all dividends accumulated on the Series\n\nG Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the then current dividend\n\nperiod have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment\n\nof such dividends has been set aside for payment. If and when all accumulated\n\ndividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series\n\nG Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for payment in\n\nfull, the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock shall be divested of the\n\nforegoing voting rights (but subject always to the same provision for the\n\nvesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in\n\nsix quarterly dividends), and if all accumulated dividends and the dividend\n\nfor the then current period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in\n\nfull on all series of Voting Parity Preferred, the term of office of each\n\ndirector so elected by the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock and the\n\nVoting Parity Preferred shall terminate.\n\n\n\n(3) As long as any shares of Series G Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the\n\nCorporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders\n\nof at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock\n\n(voting as a separate class); (i) authorize or create, or increase the\n\nauthorized or issued amount of, any Capital Stock ranking senior to the Series\n\nG Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution\n\nof assets upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up or reclassify any\n\nauthorized Capital Stock into, or create, authorize, or issue any obligation\n\nor security convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to\n\npurchase, any such shares; or (ii) amend, alter, or repeal the provisions of\n\nthese Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, whether by merger,\n\nconsolidation or otherwise (an \"Event\"), so as to materially and adversely\n\naffect any right, preference, privilege, or voting power of the Series G\n\nPreferred Stock or the holders thereof; however, as long as the Series G\n\nPreferred Stock remains outstanding with its terms\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nmaterially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of an\n\nEvent, the Corporation may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of an\n\nEvent described in clause (ii) above of this Subparagraph (3) shall not be\n\ndeemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences,\n\nprivileges, or voting power of the holders of Series G Preferred Stock, and\n\n(x) any increase in the amount of the authorized Preferred Stock or the\n\ncreation or issuance of any other series of Preferred Stock, or (y) any\n\nincrease in the amount of authorized shares of the Series G Preferred Stock or\n\nany other series of Preferred Stock, in the case of either (x) or (y) ranking\n\non a parity with or junior to the Series G Preferred Stock with respect to\n\npayment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation,\n\ndissolution, or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely\n\naffect such rights, preferences, privileges, or voting powers.\n\n\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Series G Preferred Stock shall not be\n\nentitled to vote, and the foregoing voting provisions shall not apply, if at\n\nor prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would\n\notherwise be required is effected, all outstanding shares of the Series G\n\nPreferred Stock have been redeemed or called for redemption, and sufficient\n\nfunds have been deposited in trust for the benefit of the holders of the\n\nSeries G Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.\n\n\n\n(vii) Series H Preferred Stock. Subject in all cases to the other provisions\n\nof this Section 2 of this Article III, including, without limitation, those\n\nprovisions restricting the Beneficial Ownership and Constructive Ownership of\n\nshares of Capital Stock and those provisions with respect to Excess Stock, the\n\nfollowing sets forth the designation, preferences, limitations as to\n\ndividends, voting and other rights, and the terms and conditions of redemption\n\nof the Series H Preferred Stock (defined below) of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(a) There is hereby established a series of Preferred Stock designated \"7.625%\n\nSeries H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock\" (the \"Series H Preferred\n\nStock\"), which shall consist of 3,480,000 authorized shares.\n\n\n\n(b) All shares of Series H Preferred Stock redeemed, purchased, exchanged, or\n\notherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of\n\nauthorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(c) The Series H Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend rights and\n\nrights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution, rank (i) junior to any\n\nother series of Preferred Stock hereafter duly established by the Board of\n\nDirectors of the Corporation, the terms of which specifically provide that\n\nsuch series shall rank prior to the Series H Preferred Stock as to the payment\n\nof dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation, winding up or\n\ndissolution (the \"Senior Preferred Stock\"), (ii) pari passu with the Series F\n\nPreferred Stock, the Series G Preferred Stock and any other series of\n\nPreferred Stock hereafter duly established by the Board of Directors of the\n\nCorporation, the terms of which specifically\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nprovide that such series shall rank pari passu with the Series H Preferred\n\nStock as to the payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon\n\nliquidation, winding up or dissolution (the \"Parity Preferred Stock\"), and\n\n(iii) prior to the Common Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and any other\n\nclass or series of Capital Stock, the terms of which specifically provide that\n\nsuch class or series of Capital Stock shall rank junior to the Series H\n\nPreferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon\n\nliquidation, winding up or dissolution, whether now existing or hereafter\n\ncreated (collectively, the \"Junior Stock\").\n\n\n\n(d) (1)  Subject to the rights of any Senior Preferred Stock, the holders of\n\nthe then outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to\n\nreceive, as and when declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally\n\navailable for the payment of dividends, cumulative preferential cash dividends\n\nat the annual rate of 7.625% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference\n\n(i.e., $1.90625 per annum per share). Such dividends shall accrue and be\n\ncumulative from the date of original issue and shall be payable in equal\n\nquarterly amounts in arrears on or about the last day of each March, June,\n\nSeptember, and December or, if such day is not a business day, the next\n\nsucceeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such date\n\n(each, a \"Dividend Payment Date\") (for the purposes of this Subparagraph (1)\n\nof this Paragraph (d), a \"business day\" is any day, other than a Saturday,\n\nSunday, or legal holiday, on which banks in Detroit, Michigan, are open for\n\nbusiness). The first dividend, which shall be paid on September 30, 2005, will\n\nbe for less than a full quarter. All dividends on the Series H Preferred\n\nStock, including any dividend for any partial dividend period, shall be\n\ncomputed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.\n\nDividends will be payable to holders of record as they appear in the stock\n\nrecords of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable record\n\ndate, which shall be the 15th day of the calendar month in which the\n\napplicable Dividend Payment Date falls or on such other date designed by the\n\nBoard of Directors of the Corporation for the payment of dividends that is not\n\nmore than 30 nor less than ten days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each,\n\na \"Dividend Record Date\").\n\n\n\n(2) No dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock shall be declared by the\n\nBoard of Directors or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such\n\ntime as any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to\n\nits indebtedness, prohibits such declaration, payment, or setting apart for\n\npayment or provides that such declaration, payment, or setting apart for\n\npayment would constitute a breach of, or a default under, such agreement or if\n\nsuch declaration, payment, or setting aside shall be restricted or prohibited\n\nby law.\n\n\n\n(3) Dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock shall accrue and be cumulative\n\nregardless of whether the Corporation has earnings, regardless of whether\n\nthere are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends, and\n\nregardless of whether such dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid\n\ndividends\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\non the Series H Preferred Stock will accumulate as of the Dividend Payment\n\nDate on which they first become payable.

When dividends are not paid in\n\nfull (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the\n\nSeries H Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Preferred Stock\n\nranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series H Preferred Stock, all\n\ndividends declared upon the Series H Preferred Stock and any other series of\n\nPreferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series H\n\nPreferred Stock shall be declared pro rata, so that the amount of dividends\n\ndeclared per share of Series H Preferred Stock and such other series of\n\nPreferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that\n\naccrued dividends per share on the Series H Preferred Stock and such other\n\nseries of Preferred Stock (which shall not include any accrual in respect of\n\nunpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such Preferred Stock does not\n\nhave a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest shall be payable\n\nin respect of any dividend payment on the Series H Preferred Stock that may be\n\nin arrears. Holders of shares of the Series H Preferred Stock shall not be\n\nentitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash, property, or stock, in\n\nexcess of full cumulative dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock as\n\nprovided above. Any dividend payment made on shares of the Series H Preferred\n\nStock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid\n\ndividend due with respect to such shares that remains payable.\n\n\n\n(4) If for any taxable year the Corporation elects to designate as \"capital\n\ngains dividends\" (as defined in Section 857 of the Code) any portion (the\n\n\"Capital Gains Amount\") of the dividends paid or made available for the year\n\nto holders of all classes of Capital Stock (the \"Total Dividends\"), then the\n\nportion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to the holders of\n\nSeries H Preferred Stock shall be the amount that the total dividends paid or\n\nmade available to the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock for the year\n\nbears to the Total Dividends.\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(e) Subject to the rights of any Senior Preferred Stock, upon any voluntary or\n\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the\n\nCorporation, and before any distribution of assets shall be made in respect of\n\nany Junior Stock, the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall be\n\nentitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for\n\ndistribution to its shareholders a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share\n\nin cash (or property having a fair market value as determined by the Board of\n\nDirectors valued at $25.00 per share), plus an amount equal to any accrued but\n\nunpaid dividends to the date of payment. After payment of the full amount of\n\nthe liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of\n\nSeries H Preferred Stock shall have no right or claims to any of the remaining\n\nassets of the Corporation. In the event that, upon such voluntary or\n\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the\n\nCorporation, the available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay\n\nthe amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of\n\nSeries H Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares\n\nof Parity Preferred Stock, then the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock\n\nand Parity Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of\n\nassets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would\n\notherwise be respectively entitled. Neither the consolidation or merger of the\n\nCorporation with or into any other corporation, trust, or entity (or of any\n\nother corporation with or into the Corporation) nor the sale, lease, or\n\nconveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the\n\nCorporation shall be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or\n\nwinding up of the Corporation for the purpose of this Paragraph (e) of this\n\nItem (vii). Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up\n\nof the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or\n\nplaces where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be\n\npayable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than\n\n30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each\n\nrecord holder of shares of Series H Preferred Stock at the respective\n\naddresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer\n\nrecords of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(f) (1)  The Series H Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to July 1, 2010.\n\nOn and after July 1, 2010, the Corporation, at its option upon not less than\n\n30 nor more than 60 days\u0092 written notice, may redeem shares of the Series H\n\nPreferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for a\n\ncash redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid\n\ndividends to the date fixed for redemption (except as provided below).\n\n\n\n(2) Holders of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender such\n\nshares at the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be\n\nentitled to the redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends payable\n\nupon such redemption following such surrender. If notice of redemption has\n\nbeen given and if the Corporation has set aside in trust the funds necessary\n\nfor the redemption for the benefit of the holders of the Series H Preferred\n\nStock called for\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nredemption, then from and after the redemption date: (i) dividends shall cease\n\nto accrue on such shares of Series H Preferred Stock; (ii) such shares of\n\nSeries H Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding; and (iii) all\n\nrights of the holders of such shares shall terminate, except the right to\n\nreceive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding Series H\n\nPreferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed\n\nshall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating\n\nfractional shares) or by any other equitable method determined by the\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n(3) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series H Preferred Stock\n\nshall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a\n\nsum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past\n\ndividend periods and the then current dividend period, no shares of Series H\n\nPreferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series H\n\nPreferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not\n\npurchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series H\n\nPreferred Stock or any class or series of Capital Stock ranking junior to or\n\non a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and\n\ndistribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the\n\nCorporation (except by exchange for Junior Stock); however, the foregoing\n\nshall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series H Preferred\n\nStock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to\n\nholders of all outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(4) Notice of redemption shall be mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid,\n\nnot less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed\n\nto the respective holders of record of the Series H Preferred Stock to be\n\nredeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the stock transfer\n\nrecords of the Corporation.
