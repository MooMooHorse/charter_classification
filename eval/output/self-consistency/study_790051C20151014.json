(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate of\n\nIncorporation or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the\n\nbusiness and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the\n\ndirection of a Board of Directors consisting of such number as may be fixed,\n\nfrom time to time, by the By-Laws of the Corporation; but not less than three\n\n(3).

For\n\npurposes of this Article FIFTH, cause for removal shall be construed to exist\n\nonly if the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted of a felony\n\nby a court of competent jurisdiction or has been adjudged by a court of\n\ncompetent jurisdiction to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the\n\nperformance of his duty to the Corporation in a matter of substantial\n\nimportance to the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(iii) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock\n\nthen outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in\n\nthe authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors\n\nresulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from\n\noffice or other cause shall be filled by a majority vote of the directors then\n\nin office, and directors so chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at\n\nthe Annual Meeting of Stockholders at which the term of the class to which\n\nthey have been elected expires.\n\n\n\nB.

Election of directors shall be by ballot whenever requested by a majority\n\nof the persons entitled to vote and present at any meeting of the stockholders\n\nof the Corporation but unless so requested may be held in any way approved at\n\nthe stockholders\u0092 meeting.\n\n\n\nD. Nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of\n\nDirectors or any committee thereof or by any stockholder of the Corporation\n\nentitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Nominations other\n\nthan those made by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall be made\n\nby a notice in writing (the \u0093Notice\u0094) received by the Secretary of the\n\nCorporation not less than ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of\n\nthe date of the last meeting of stockholders of the Corporation called for the\n\nelection of directors.\n\n\n\nEach Notice shall set forth: (i) the name, address and qualifications of the\n\nperson making the nomination; (ii) the name, age, business address and, if\n\nknown, residence address of each nominee proposed in such Notice; (iii) the\n\nprincipal occupation or employment of each such nominee; (iv) the number of\n\nshares of capital stock of the Corporation of which each such nominee is the\n\nBeneficial Owner (as defined in Article SEVENTH); and (v) such other\n\ninformation as would be required by the securities laws of the United States\n\nand the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder in respect of an\n\nindividual nominated as a director of the Corporation and for whom proxies are\n\nsolicited by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.\n\n\n\nThe presiding officer at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may,\n\nif the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination\n\nwas not made in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Article FIFTH,\n\nand if he should so determine and declare to the meeting, the defective\n\nnomination shall be without legal force and effect and shall be disregarded.\n\n\n\nSIXTH: No action required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or\n\nspecial meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a\n\nmeeting, and the power of stockholders of the Corporation to take any such\n\naction by means of a consent or consents in writing, without a meeting, is\n\nspecifically denied.\n\n\n\nSEVENTH: A. In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or under any\n\nother provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and except as\n\notherwise expressly provided in subparagraph B of this Article SEVENTH, any\n\nBusiness Combination (as hereinafter defined) with respect to a Substantial\n\nStockholder (as hereinafter defined) shall require the affirmative vote of the\n\nholders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting\n\npower of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation\n\nentitled to vote generally in the election of directors, considered for the\n\npurpose of this Article SEVENTH as one class (\u0093Voting Shares\u0094). Such\n\naffirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may\n\nbe required, or that some lesser percentage may be specified, by law or in any\n\nagreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise.\n\n\n\nB. The provisions of subparagraph A of this Article SEVENTH shall not be\n\napplicable to a Business Combination, and such Business Combination shall\n\nrequire only such affirmative vote as is required by law and any other\n\nprovision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if:\n\n\n\n1\\. A definitive agreement or other arrangement to effectuate the Business\n\nCombination was approved by a majority of the directors of the Corporation at\n\na time when the Substantial Stockholder who is a party to the Business\n\nCombination was not the Beneficial Owner (as hereinafter defined) of five\n\npercent (5%) or more of the outstanding Voting Shares of the Corporation; or\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2\\. The Business Combination is approved by a majority of the Continuing\n\nDirectors (as hereinafter defined); such approval shall be made by a majority\n\nof the Continuing Directors even if such majority does not constitute a quorum\n\nof the members of the Board of Directors then in office and shall be in\n\naddition to any other approval of the Corporation\u0092s Board of Directors\n\nrequired by law and any other provision of this Restated Certificate of\n\nIncorporation; or\n\n\n\n3\\.
