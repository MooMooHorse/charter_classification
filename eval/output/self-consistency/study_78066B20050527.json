In the\n\n               event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any\n\n               dividend on Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a\n\n               subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding\n\n               Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment\n\n               of a dividend in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number\n\n               of Common Shares, then the number 100 (or such number to which it\n\n               may previously have been adjusted) in subclause (ii) of the\n\n               preceding sentence shall be adjusted (or further adjusted) by\n\n               multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is\n\n               the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such\n\n               event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares\n\n               that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n                    B. Holders of the Junior Preferred Shares shall be entitled\n\n               to receive such dividends in preference to and in priority over\n\n               dividends upon the Common Shares and upon any other shares which\n\n               are by their terms junior to the Junior Preferred Shares as to\n\n               dividends. Junior Preferred Shares shall be junior as to\n\n               dividends to any other Preferred Shares which are by their terms\n\n               senior to the Junior Preferred Shares as to dividends, and if at\n\n               any time the Corporation has failed to pay accrued dividends on\n\n               any such other Preferred Shares at the time outstanding at the\n\n               times such dividends are payable, the Corporation shall not\n\n               declare or pay any dividends on the Junior Preferred Shares.\n\n\n\n                    C. If at any time the Corporation has failed to pay accrued\n\n               dividends on any Junior Preferred Shares at the time outstanding\n\n               at the times such dividends are payable, the Corporation shall\n\n               not\n\n\n\n                         (i) declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares or\n\n                    make any payment on account of, or set apart money for a\n\n                    sinking or other analogous fund for, the purchase,\n\n                    redemption or other retirement of any Common Shares or make\n\n                    any distribution in respect thereof, either directly or\n\n                    indirectly and whether in cash or property or in obligations\n\n                    or shares of the Corporation (other than in Common Shares),\n\n\n\n                         (ii) purchase any Junior Preferred Shares (except for a\n\n                    consideration payable in Common Shares), or\n\n\n\n                         (iii) permit any corporation or other entity directly\n\n                    or indirectly controlled by the Corporation to purchase any\n\n                    Common Shares or Junior Preferred Shares, unless, in the\n\n                    case of any such dividend, payment, distribution, purchase\n\n                    or redemption, all dividends accrued and payable but unpaid\n\n                    on the Junior Preferred Shares have been or\n\n                    contemporaneously are declared and paid in full or declared\n\n                    and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for\n\n                    such payment.\n\n\n\n                    D. The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution\n\n               on the Junior Preferred Shares as provided in subclause A of this\n\n               clause (2) immediately after it declares a dividend or\n\n               distribution on the Common Shares (other than a dividend payable\n\n               in Common Shares); provided that, in the event no dividend or\n\n               distribution shall have been declared on the Common Shares during\n\n               the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the\n\n               next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of\n\n               $2.50 per share ($10.00 per annum) on the Junior Preferred Shares\n\n               shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly\n\n               Dividend Payment Date. The Board of Directors may change any of\n\n               the Quarterly Dividend Payment Dates to a different date to\n\n               coincide with the payment date for a dividend or distribution on\n\n               the Common Shares.\n\n\n\n                    E. Dividends at the $10.00 minimum annual rate shall begin\n\n               to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding Junior Preferred\n\n               Shares from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding\n\n               the date of issue of such Junior Preferred Shares, unless the\n\n               date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the\n\n               first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on\n\n               such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such\n\n               shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend\n\n               Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the\n\n               determination of holders of Junior Preferred Shares entitled to\n\n               receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend\n\n               Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall\n\n               begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend\n\n               Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall accumulate but\n\n               shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Junior\n\n               Preferred Shares in an amount less than the total amount of such\n\n               dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be\n\n               allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such\n\n               shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a\n\n               record date for the determination of holders of Junior Preferred\n\n               Shares entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution\n\n               declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 50\n\n               days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.\n\n\n\n               (3) NO REDEMPTION. The Junior Preferred Shares shall not be\n\n          redeemable.\n\n\n\n               (4) LIQUIDATION.\n\n\n\n                    A. The liquidation price of the Junior Preferred Shares, in\n\n               case of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or\n\n               winding-up of the Corporation, shall be an amount per share equal\n\n               to the greater of (i) $100 and (ii) an aggregate amount (subject\n\n               to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to\n\n               100 times the aggregate per share amount to be distributed to\n\n               holders of Common Shares. In the event the Corporation shall at\n\n               any time declare or pay any dividend on Common Shares payable in\n\n               Common Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination or\n\n               consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by\n\n               reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in\n\n               Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares,\n\n               then the number 100 (or such number to which it may previously\n\n               have been adjusted) in subclause (ii) of the preceding sentence\n\n               shall be adjusted (or further adjusted) by multiplying such\n\n               number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of\n\n               Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event and the\n\n               denominator of which is the number of Common Shares that were\n\n               outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n                    B. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,\n\n               dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, the holders of\n\n               Junior Preferred Shares (i) shall not be entitled to receive the\n\n               liquidation price of such shares held by them until the\n\n               liquidation price of any other Preferred Shares which are by\n\n               their terms senior to the Junior Preferred Shares as to the\n\n               distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary\n\n               liquidation of the Corporation shall have been paid in full and\n\n               (ii) shall be entitled to receive the liquidation price of such\n\n               shares held by them in preference to and in priority over any\n\n               distributions upon the Common Shares and upon any other shares\n\n               which are by their terms junior to the Junior Preferred Shares as\n\n               to the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary\n\n               liquidation of the Corporation. Upon payment in full of the\n\n               liquidation price to which the holders of Junior Preferred Shares\n\n               are entitled, the holders of Junior Preferred Shares will not be\n\n               entitled to any further participation in any distribution of\n\n               assets by the Corporation. If the assets of the Corporation are\n\n               not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation price payable to\n\n               the holders of Junior Preferred Shares, the holders of all such\n\n               shares shall share pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all\n\n               such shares at the time outstanding.\n\n\n\n                    C. Neither a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with\n\n               or into any other corporation, nor a merger of any other\n\n               corporation with or into the Corporation, nor a sale or transfer\n\n               of all or any part of the Corporation's assets for cash or\n\n               securities shall be considered a liquidation, dissolution or\n\n               winding-up of the Corporation within the meaning of this clause\n\n               (4).\n\n\n\n               (5) CONVERTIBILITY. The Junior Preferred Shares shall not be\n\n          convertible into any other securities of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n               (6) OTHER SHARES. The Junior Preferred Shares do not restrict in\n\n          any way the issuance of any additional shares (including additional\n\n          Junior Preferred Shares) ranking on a parity with or prior to the\n\n          Junior Preferred Shares either as to dividends or upon liquidation or\n\n          any additional Common Shares or other shares that may be entitled to\n\n          vote with the Junior Preferred Shares. Any Junior Preferred Shares\n\n          which are acquired by the Corporation and subsequently cancelled by\n\n          the Board of Directors shall have the status of authorized but\n\n          unissued Preferred Shares, without designation as to series, subject\n\n          to reissuance by the Board of Directors as Junior Preferred Shares or\n\n          of any one or more series.\n\n\n\n               (7) VOTING RIGHTS. The holders of Junior Preferred Shares shall\n\n          have the following voting rights:\n\n\n\n                    A. Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set\n\n               forth, each Junior Preferred Share shall entitle the holder\n\n               thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of\n\n               shareholders of the Corporation and the holders of Junior\n\n               Preferred Shares and the holders of Common Shares shall vote\n\n               together as one class on all such matters. In the event the\n\n               Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on\n\n               Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a subdivision\n\n               or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares\n\n               (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend\n\n               in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common\n\n               Shares, then the number 100 in the preceding sentence (or such\n\n               number to which it may previously have been adjusted) shall be\n\n               adjusted (or further adjusted) by multiplying such number by a\n\n               fraction the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares\n\n               outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of\n\n               which is the number of Common Shares that were outstanding\n\n               immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n                    B. Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law,\n\n               the holders of Junior Preferred Shares shall have no voting\n\n               rights for taking any corporate action.\n\n\n\n               (8) CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC. In case the Corporation shall\n\n          enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction\n\n          in which the Common Shares are exchanged for or changed into other\n\n          stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such\n\n          case (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth)\n\n          each Junior Preferred Share shall at the same time be similarly\n\n          exchanged for or changed into 100 times the aggregate per share amount\n\n          of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in\n\n          kind), as the case may be, for which or into which each Common Share\n\n          is exchanged or changed. In the event the Corporation shall at any\n\n          time declare or pay any dividend on Common Shares payable in Common\n\n          Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the\n\n          outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by\n\n          payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser\n\n          number of Common Shares, then the number 100 in the preceding sentence\n\n          (or such number to which it may previously have been adjusted) shall\n\n          be adjusted (or further adjusted) by multiplying such number by a\n\n          fraction the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares\n\n          outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which\n\n          is the number of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior\n\n          to such event.\n\n\n\n               (9) DEFINITION OF \"COMMON SHARES\". As used in this Paragraph A.1\n\n          of this Certificate of Incorporation, the term \"Common Shares\" shall\n\n          mean the Common Shares of the Corporation having a par value of six\n\n          dollars and twenty-five cents ($6.25) per share, as such shares may be\n\n          changed through any subdivision, combination or consolidation thereof.\n\n\n\n                    B. Except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of\n\n               New York or by any certificate of amendment filed pursuant to\n\n               Paragraph A of this Article THIRD, setting forth the relative\n\n               rights, preferences and limitations of any series of Preferred\n\n               Shares, the entire voting power of the shares of the Corporation\n\n               for the election of Directors and for all other purposes, as well\n\n               as all other rights appertaining to shares of the Corporation,\n\n               shall be vested exclusively in the Common Shares. Each Common\n\n               Share shall have one vote upon all matters to be voted on by the\n\n               holders of the Common Shares, and shall be entitled to\n\n               participate equally in all dividends payable with respect to the\n\n               Common Shares and to share ratably, subject to the rights and\n\n               preferences of any such Preferred Shares, in all assets of the\n\n               Corporation in the event of any voluntary or involuntary\n\n               liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the\n\n               Corporation.\n\n\n\n                    C. No present or future holder of any shares of the\n\n               Corporation, whether heretofore or hereafter issued, shall have\n\n               any preemptive rights with respect to (a) any shares of the\n\n               Corporation or (b) any other securities of the Corporation\n\n               (including bonds and debentures) convertible into or carrying\n\n               rights or options to purchase any shares of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n     FOURTH: The office of the Corporation shall be located in the City of New\n\nYork, County of New York, State of New York.
