Conversion.\n\n\n\n#\n\n\n\nEach share of Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of Common\n\nStock as provided in this SECTION 5.\n\n\n\n## (a) Conversion at the Option of Holders of Series C Preferred Stock.\n\nSubject to SECTION 5(b), each holder of Series C Preferred Stock is entitled\n\nto convert, at any time and from time to time, at the option and election of\n\nsuch holder, any or all shares of outstanding Series C Preferred Stock held by\n\nsuch holder into a number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and\n\nnonassessable shares of Common Stock equal to the amount (the \u0093Conversion\n\nAmount\u0094) determined by dividing (i) the Original Purchase Price for each share\n\nof Series C Preferred Stock to be converted by such holder by (ii) the\n\nConversion Price in effect at the time of conversion. The \u0093Conversion Price,\u0094\n\nwith respect to each share of Series C Preferred Stock, initially is the\n\nconversion price of the Notes in effect immediately prior to the conversion of\n\nsuch Notes into shares of Series C Preferred Stock, as adjusted from time to\n\ntime as provided in SECTION 5(f). In order to convert shares of Series C\n\nPreferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder must surrender the\n\ncertificates representing such shares of Series C Preferred Stock, accompanied\n\nby transfer instruments reasonably satisfactory to the Company, free of any\n\nadverse interest or liens at the office of the Company\u0092s transfer agent for\n\nthe Series C Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Company, if\n\nthe Company serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice\n\nthat such holder elects to convert all or such number of shares represented by\n\nsuch certificates as specified therein. With respect to a conversion pursuant\n\nto this SECTION 5(a) or SECTION 5(c), the date of receipt of such\n\ncertificates, together with such notice, by the transfer agent or the Company\n\nwill be the date of conversion (the \u0093Conversion Date\u0094).\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n## (b) Limitations on Conversion. Notwithstanding SECTION 5(a), but subject to\n\nSECTION 5(c), the Company shall not effect any conversion of the Series C\n\nPreferred Stock or otherwise issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to SECTION\n\n5(a), and no holder of Series C Preferred Stock will be permitted to convert\n\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock if, and to the\n\nextent that, following such conversion, either (i) such holder\u0092s, together\n\nwith such holder\u0092s Affiliates\u0092, aggregate voting power on a matter being voted\n\non by holders of\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n## Common Stock would exceed 19.9% of the Maximum Voting Power or (ii) such\n\nholder, together with such holder\u0092s Affiliates, would Beneficially Own\n\n(disregarding for this purpose clause (ii) of the definition of \u0093Beneficially\n\nOwn\u0094) more than 19.9% of the then outstanding Common Stock; provided, however,\n\nthat such conversion restriction shall not apply to any conversion in\n\nconnection with and subject to completion of (A) a Public Sale of the Common\n\nStock to be issued upon such conversion, if following consummation of such\n\nPublic Sale such holder and its Affiliates will not Beneficially Own\n\n(disregarding for this purpose clause (ii) of the definition of \u0093Beneficially\n\nOwn\u0094) in excess of 19.9% of the then outstanding Common Stock or (B) a bona\n\nfide third party tender offer for the Common Stock issuable thereupon. For\n\npurposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock\n\nBeneficially Owned by a holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred\n\nStock with respect to which a conversion notice has been given, but shall\n\nexclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon\n\nconversion or exercise of (x) the remaining, unconverted portion of the Series\n\nC Preferred Stock and any Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred\n\nStock, (y) any outstanding Notes, or (z) any outstanding Warrants (as defined\n\nin the Securities Purchase Agreement) Beneficially Owned by such holder or any\n\nof its Affiliates. Upon the written request of the holder, the Company shall\n\nwithin two (2) Business Days confirm in writing to any holder the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock then outstanding. For purposes hereof, \u0093Maximum Voting\n\nPower\u0094 means, at the time of determination of the Maximum Voting Power, the\n\ntotal number of votes which may be cast by all capital stock on the applicable\n\nmatter subject to the vote of the Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and\n\nany other securities that constitute Voting Stock voting together as a single\n\nclass and after giving effect to any limitation on voting power set forth in\n\nthe Certificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock and the\n\ncertificate of designation or other similar document governing other Voting\n\nStock.\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n## (c) Automatic Conversion. If at any time the limitations in SECTION 5(b)\n\nwould not prevent the conversion of one or more shares of Series C Preferred\n\nStock into Common Stock, then, subject to any lapse or expiration of the\n\napplicable waiting period, or approval, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust\n\nImprovements Act of 1976, as amended, or other applicable antitrust law, the\n\nmaximum number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by a holder and its\n\nAffiliates that can convert into Common Stock without violating the\n\nlimitations in SECTION 5(b) will automatically convert into Common Stock,\n\nprovided that such automatic conversion shall only occur if the number of\n\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock that would be converted on the Conversion\n\nDate is equal to or greater than the lesser of (x) 1,000 and (y) all shares\n\nthen held by such holder and its Affiliates; provided, further, that if the\n\nnumber of shares of Series C Preferred Stock that may be converted pursuant to\n\nthis SECTION 5(c) is less than all shares of Series C Preferred Stock\n\nBeneficially Owned by a holder and its Affiliates, the Company shall select\n\nthe shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted by lot, or on a pro\n\nrata basis.\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n## (d) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued\n\nupon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares,\n\nthe Company shall pay cash equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the\n\nFair Market Value of Common Stock as of the Conversion Date. If more than one\n\nshare of Series C Preferred Stock is being converted at one time by the same\n\nholder, then the number of full shares issuable upon conversion will be\n\ncalculated on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series C\n\nPreferred Stock converted by such holder at such time.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n## (e) Mechanics of Conversion.\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n### (i) As soon as practicable after the Conversion Date (and in any event\n\nwithin three Business Days), the Company shall (A) issue and deliver to such\n\nholder the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled,\n\ntogether with a check or cash for payment of fractional shares, if any, in\n\nexchange for the certificates formerly representing shares of Series C\n\nPreferred Stock and (B) pay to such holder, to the extent of funds legally\n\navailable therefor, all accrued and unpaid Dividends on the shares of Series C\n\nPreferred Stock that are being converted into Common Stock. Such conversion\n\nwill be deemed to have been made on the Conversion Date, and the person\n\nentitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion\n\nshall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of\n\nCommon Stock on such Conversion Date. In case fewer than all the shares\n\nrepresented by any such certificate are to be converted, a new certificate\n\nshall be issued representing the unconverted shares without cost to the holder\n\nthereof, except for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax\n\ndue because any certificates for shares of Common Stock or Series C Preferred\n\nStock are issued in a name other than the name of the converting holder. The\n\nCompany shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due\n\non the issue of Common Stock upon conversion or due upon the issuance of a new\n\ncertificate for any shares of Series C Preferred Stock not converted other\n\nthan any such tax due because shares of Common Stock or a certificate for\n\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock are issued in a name other than the name of\n\nthe converting holder.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (ii) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from\n\nany preemptive rights, out of its treasury or out of authorized but unissued\n\nshares of Common Stock (or a combination of both) for the purpose of effecting\n\nthe conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock the full number of shares of\n\nCommon Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding Series C\n\nPreferred Stock (as may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the terms of\n\nthis SECTION 5 and assuming for the purposes of this calculation that all\n\noutstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are held by one holder), and\n\nthe Company shall take all actions to amend its Certificate of Incorporation\n\nto increase the authorized amount of Common Stock if necessary therefor.\n\nBefore taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the\n\nConversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock\n\nissuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Company will\n\ntake any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be\n\nnecessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid\n\nand nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (iii) From and after the Conversion Date, the shares of Series C Preferred\n\nStock to be converted on such Conversion Date will no longer be deemed to be\n\noutstanding, and all rights of the holder thereof as a holder of Series C\n\nPreferred Stock (except the right to receive from the Company the Common Stock\n\nupon conversion, together with the right to receive any payment in lieu of a\n\nfractional share of Common Stock and any accrued and unpaid Dividends thereon)\n\nshall cease and terminate with respect to such shares; provided, that in the\n\nevent that a share of Series C Preferred Stock is not converted, such share of\n\nSeries C Preferred Stock will remain outstanding and will be entitled to all\n\nof the rights as provided herein.

Except as set forth in the\n\npreceding sentence, in no event shall the Conversion Price be increased\n\npursuant to this SECTION 5(f)(i).\n\n\n\n#### (B) If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of\n\nthe Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, subdivide or reclassify its\n\noutstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common\n\nStock, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the\n\nday upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately\n\ndecreased, and conversely, if the Company shall, at any time or from time to\n\ntime while any of the Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, combine or\n\nreclassify its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of\n\nshares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of\n\nbusiness on the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes\n\neffective shall be proportionately increased. In each such case, the\n\nConversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a\n\nfraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination and the\n\ndenominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding\n\nimmediately after giving effect to such subdivision, combination or\n\nreclassification. Such increase or reduction, as the case may be, shall become\n\neffective immediately after the opening of business on the day upon which such\n\nsubdivision, combination or reclassification becomes effective.\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n### (ii) Adjustment for Rights Issue. If the Company shall, at any time or\n\nfrom time to time, while any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are\n\noutstanding, distribute rights, options or warrants to all or substantially\n\nall holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period expiring within\n\n60 days after the record date for such distribution, to purchase shares of\n\nCommon Stock, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable\n\nfor, Common Stock, in either case, at less than the average of the Closing\n\nPrices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first\n\npublic announcement of the distribution, then the Conversion Price shall be\n\nadjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the\n\nConversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date\n\nfor such distribution by a fraction:\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n#### (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares\n\nof Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the Business Day\n\nimmediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, plus (2) the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of the\n\ntotal number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights,\n\noptions or warrants would purchase at the Current Market Price of the\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n#### Common Stock on the declaration date for such distribution (determined by\n\nmultiplying such total number of shares of Common Stock so offered by the\n\nexercise price of such rights, options or warrants and dividing the product so\n\nobtained by such Current Market Price); and\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n#### (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common\n\nStock outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately\n\npreceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, plus the total number of\n\nadditional shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or\n\nwarrants.\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\nSuch adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of\n\nbusiness on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.\n\n\n\nTo the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such\n\nrights, options or warrants or upon the expiration or termination of such\n\nrights, options or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the\n\nConversion Price that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon\n\nthe issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of the\n\ndelivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In\n\nthe event that such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the\n\nConversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which\n\nwould then be in effect if the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution had not\n\noccurred. In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the\n\nholders to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the\n\nClosing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the\n\nfirst public announcement of the relevant distribution, and in determining the\n\naggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken\n\ninto account any consideration received for such rights, options or warrants\n\nand the value of such consideration if other than cash, to be determined in\n\ngood faith by the Board of Directors. Except as set forth in this paragraph,\n\nin no event shall the Conversion Price be increased pursuant to this SECTION\n\n5(f)(ii).\n\n\n\n### (iii) Adjustment for Certain Tender Offers or Exchange Offers. In case the\n\nCompany or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at any time or from time to time,\n\nwhile any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, distribute\n\ncash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or an exchange offer\n\n(that is treated as a \u0093tender offer\u0094 under U.S. federal securities laws) made\n\nby the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock,\n\nwhere the sum of the aggregate amount of such cash distributed and the\n\naggregate Fair Market Value, as of the Expiration Date (as defined below), of\n\nsuch other consideration distributed (such sum, the \u0093Aggregate Amount\u0094)\n\nexpressed as an amount per share of Common Stock validly tendered or\n\nexchanged, and not withdrawn, pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer\n\nas of the Expiration Time (as defined below) (such tendered or exchanged\n\nshares of Common Stock, the \u0093Purchased Shares\u0094) exceeds the Closing Price per\n\nshare of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day immediately following the\n\nlast date (such last date, the \u0093Expiration Date\u0094) on which tenders or\n\nexchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer\n\n(as the same may be amended through the Expiration Date), then, and in each\n\ncase, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion\n\nPrice shall be decreased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by\n\nmultiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of\n\nbusiness on the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date by a\n\nfraction:\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n#### (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the product of (A) the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the last time (the\n\n\u0093Expiration Time\u0094) at which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant\n\nto such tender offer or exchange offer (including all Purchased Shares) and\n\n(B) the Closing Price per share of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day\n\nimmediately following the Expiration Date; and\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n#### (B) the denominator of which is equal to the sum of (x) the Aggregate\n\nAmount and (y) the product of (I) an amount equal to (1) the number of shares\n\nof Common Stock outstanding as of the Expiration Time, less (2) the Purchased\n\nShares and (II) the Closing Price per share of the Common Stock on the first\n\nTrading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\nAn adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Price pursuant to this SECTION\n\n5(f)(iii) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business\n\non the second Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date. In the\n\nevent that the Company or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of\n\nCommon Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the\n\nCompany or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from\n\neffecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the\n\nConversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which\n\nwould then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been\n\nmade. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of\n\nthis SECTION 5(f)(iii) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in\n\nan increase in the Conversion Price, no adjustment shall be made for such\n\ntender offer or exchange offer under this SECTION 5(f)(iii).\n\n\n\n### (iv) Disposition Events.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n#### (A) If any of the following events (any such event, a \u0093Disposition\n\nEvent\u0094) occurs:\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n##### (1) any reclassification or exchange of the Common Stock (other than a\n\nchange in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value\n\nto par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination);\n\n\n\n#####\n\n\n\n##### (2) any merger, consolidation or other combination to which the Company\n\nis a constituent party; or\n\n\n\n#####\n\n\n\n##### (3) any sale, conveyance, lease, or other disposal of all or\n\nsubstantially all the properties and assets of the Company to any other\n\nperson;\n\n\n\n#####\n\n\n\nin each case, as a result of which all of the holders of Common Stock shall be\n\nentitled to receive cash, securities or other property for their shares of\n\nCommon Stock, the Company or the successor or purchasing person, as the case\n\nmay be, shall provide that the Series C Preferred Stock converted following\n\nthe effective date of any Disposition Event, shall be converted, in lieu of\n\nthe Common Stock otherwise deliverable, into the same amount and type (in the\n\nsame proportion) of cash, securities or other property received by holders of\n\nCommon Stock in the relevant event (collectively, \u0093Reference Property\u0094)\n\nreceived upon the occurrence of such Disposition Event by a holder of Common\n\nStock holding, immediately prior to the transaction, a number of shares of\n\nCommon Stock equal to the Conversion Amount (without giving effect to any\n\nlimitations on\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nconversion set forth in SECTION 5(b)) immediately prior to such Disposition\n\nEvent; provided that if the Disposition Event provides the holders of Common\n\nStock with the right to receive more than a single type of consideration\n\ndetermined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, the Reference\n\nProperty shall be comprised of the weighted average of the types and amounts\n\nof consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock. The Company may\n\nnot cause, or agree to cause, a Disposition Event to occur, unless the issuer\n\nof any securities or other property into which the Series C Preferred Stock\n\nthat remains outstanding thereafter (if any) becomes convertible agrees, for\n\nthe express benefit of the holders of record of Series C Preferred Stock\n\n(including making them beneficiaries of such agreement), to issue such\n\nsecurities or property.\n\n\n\n#### (B) The above provisions of this SECTION 5(f)(iv) shall similarly apply\n\nto successive Disposition Events. If this SECTION 5(f)(iv) applies to any\n\nevent or occurrence, neither SECTION 5(f)(i) nor SECTION 5(f)(iii) shall\n\napply; provided, however, that this SECTION 5(f)(iv) shall not apply to any\n\nstock split or combination to which SECTION 5(f)(i) is applicable or to a\n\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up to which SECTION 3 applies. To the\n\nextent that equity securities of a company are received by the holders of\n\nCommon Stock in connection with a Disposition Event, the portion of the Series\n\nC Preferred Stock which will be convertible into such equity securities will\n\ncontinue to be subject to the anti-dilution adjustments set forth in this\n\nSECTION 5(f).\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n### (v) Minimum Adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion\n\nPrice will not be reduced if the amount of such reduction would be an amount\n\nless than $0.01, but any such amount will be carried forward and reduction\n\nwith respect thereto will be made at the time that such amount, together with\n\nany subsequent amounts so carried forward, aggregates to $0.01 or more.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (vi) When No Adjustment Required.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n#### (A) No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in SECTION\n\n5(f)(i) or SECTION 5(f)(ii) if the Series C Preferred Stock participates,\n\nwithout conversion, in the transaction or event that would otherwise give rise\n\nto an adjustment pursuant to such Section at the same time as holders of the\n\nCommon Stock participate with respect to such transaction or event and on the\n\nsame terms as holders of the Common Stock participate with respect to such\n\ntransaction or event as if the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, at such\n\ntime, held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Amount\n\nat such time.\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n#### (B) No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock\n\npursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest.\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n#### (C) No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par\n\nvalue of the Common Stock.\n\n\n\n####\n\n\n\n#### (D) To the extent the Series C Preferred Stock become convertible\n\npursuant to this SECTION 5 into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as\n\nto the cash. Interest will not accrue on the cash.\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (vii) Rules of Calculation; Treasury Stock. All calculations will be made\n\nto the nearest one-hundredth of a cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth of\n\na share. Except as explicitly provided herein, the number of shares of Common\n\nStock outstanding will be calculated on the basis of the number of issued and\n\noutstanding shares of Common Stock, not including shares held in the treasury\n\nof the Company. The Company shall not pay any dividend on or make any\n\ndistribution to shares of Common Stock held in treasury.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (viii) Waiver. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price will\n\nnot be reduced if the Company receives, prior to the effective time of the\n\nadjustment to the Conversion Price, written notice from the holders\n\nrepresenting at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C\n\nPreferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, that no adjustment is to\n\nbe made as the result of a particular issuance of Common Stock or other\n\ndividend or other distribution on shares of Common Stock. This waiver will be\n\nlimited in scope and will not be valid for any issuance of Common Stock or\n\nother dividend or other distribution on shares of Common Stock not\n\nspecifically provided for in such notice.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (ix) Tax Adjustment. Anything in this SECTION 5 notwithstanding, the\n\nCompany shall be entitled to make such downward adjustments in the Conversion\n\nPrice, in addition to those required by this SECTION 5, as the Board in its\n\nsole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any event\n\ntreated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend or stock split will not\n\nbe taxable to the holders of Common Stock.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (x) Par Value. Anything in this SECTION 5 notwithstanding, no adjustment\n\nto the Conversion Price shall reduce the Conversion Price below the then par\n\nvalue per share of Common Stock, and any such purported adjustment shall\n\ninstead reduce the Conversion Price to such par value.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (xi) No Duplication. If any action would require adjustment of the\n\nConversion Price pursuant to more than one of the provisions described in this\n\nSECTION 5 in a manner such that such adjustments are duplicative, only one\n\nadjustment shall be made.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n### (xii) Provisions Governing Adjustment to Conversion Price.
