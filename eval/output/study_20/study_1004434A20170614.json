In the event that there shall have been surrendered a certificate or\n\ncertificates representing Class B Common Stock, only part of which are to be\n\nconverted, the Corporation shall issue and send to such holder or such holder's\n\ndesignee, in the manner set forth in the preceding sentence, a new certificate\n\nor certificates representing the number of shares of Class B Common Stock which\n\nshall not have been converted. If the certificate or certificates for Common\n\nStock are to be issued in a name other than the name of the registered holder of\n\nthe stock surrendered for conversion, the Corporation shall not be obligated to\n\nissue or deliver any certificate unless and until the holder of the stock\n\nsurrendered has paid to the Corporation the amount of any tax that may be\n\npayable in respect of any transfer involved in such issuance or has established\n\nto the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.\n\n\n\n                  (d) Effective Date of Conversion.

In the event that the\n\nCorporation shall (i) pay a dividend in or make a distribution in shares of its\n\nClass B Common Stock, (ii) subdivide its outstanding shares of Class B Common\n\nStock, (iii) combine its outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock into a\n\nsmaller number of shares, or (iv) issue by reclassification of its shares of\n\nClass B Common Stock any shares of the Corporation, the Class B Common\n\nConversion Rate in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that\n\nthe holder of a share of Class B Common Stock thereafter surrendered for\n\nconversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock\n\nwhich it would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening\n\nof any of the events described above had such share of Class B Common Stock been\n\nconverted on or immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or the\n\neffective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, as the case\n\nmay be.\n\n\n\n                  (c) General. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 6\n\nshall become effective immediately after the record date (in the case of a\n\ndividend or distribution in shares of capital stock) and shall become effective\n\nimmediately after the effective date (in the case of a subdivision, combination\n\nor reclassification). No adjustment in accordance with this Section 6 shall be\n\nrequired unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease in any\n\nconversion rate of at least 0.1%; provided, however, that any adjustments which\n\nby reason of this clause are not required to be made shall be carried forward\n\nand taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.\n\n\n\n         Section 7. Notices. In the event that the Corporation provides any\n\nnotice, report or statement to the holders of Common Stock or Class B Common\n\nStock (in their capacity as such), the Corporation shall at the same time\n\nprovide a copy of any such notice, report or statement to each record holder of\n\noutstanding Class B Common Stock and each record holder of Common Stock.\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\n\n\n<PAGE>   8\n\n\n\n                                    ARTICLE V\n\n\n\n                               STOCKHOLDER ACTION\n\n\n\n         Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the\n\nCorporation at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation\n\nmust be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and\n\nmay not be taken or effected by a written consent of stockholders in lieu\n\nthereof.\n\n\n\n                                   ARTICLE VI\n\n\n\n                                    DIRECTORS\n\n\n\n         Section 1.
