For purposes of this provision, the actuarial value of\n\nthe interest in a trust of any person in whose favor a testamentary power of\n\nappointment may be exercised shall be deemed to be zero. For purposes of this\n\nprovision, in the case of a trust created by a Lauder Descendant, the actuarial\n\nvalue of the interest in such trust of any person who may receive trust property\n\nonly at the termination of the trust and then only in the event that, at the\n\ntermination of the trust, there are no living issue of such Lauder Descendant\n\nshall be deemed to be zero. For purposes of this Article IV, the term \"Spouses\n\nof Lauder Descendants\" shall mean those individuals who at any time were married\n\nto any Lauder Descendant whether or not such marriage is subsequently dissolved\n\nby death, divorce, or by any other means.\n\n\n\n                           (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set\n\nforth herein, any Class B Holder may pledge such Class B Holder's shares of\n\nClass B Common Stock to a financial institution pursuant to a bona fide pledge\n\nof such shares as collateral security for indebtedness due to the pledgee;\n\nprovided, that, such shares shall remain subject to the provisions of this\n\nSection 4.2(c) and may not be transferred to, or voted by, the pledgee, except\n\nas otherwise permitted by the provisions of Section 4.2(c). In the event of\n\nforeclosure or other similar action by the pledgee, such pledged shares of Class\n\nB Common Stock may only be transferred to a Permitted Transferee or converted\n\ninto shares of Class A Common Stock, as the pledgee may elect.\n\n\n\n                           (iii) For purposes of this Section 4.2(c):\n\n\n\n                                     1.  the relationship of any person that is\n\n               derived by or through legal adoption shall be considered a\n\n               natural relationship;\n\n\n\n                                     2.  a minor who is a descendant of Mrs.\n\n               Estee Lauder and for whom shares of Class B Common Stock are held\n\n               pursuant to a Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or similar law shall be\n\n               considered a Class B Holder\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n               of such shares and the custodian who is the record holder of such\n\n               shares shall not be considered a Class B Holder;\n\n\n\n                                     3.  an incompetent stockholder who is a\n\n               Permitted transferee but whose shares are owned or held by a\n\n               guardian or conservator shall be considered a Class B Holder of\n\n               such shares and such guardian or conservator who is the holder of\n\n               such shares shall not be considered a Class B Holder;\n\n\n\n                                     4.  unless otherwise specified, the term\n\n               \"person\" means and includes natural persons, corporations,\n\n               partnerships, unincorporated associations, firms, joint ventures,\n\n               trusts and all other entities; and\n\n\n\n                                     5.  except as provided in clauses 2 and 3\n\n               above, the term \"Class B Holder\" shall mean in respect of any\n\n               share of Class B Common Stock, the record holder of such share;\n\n               provided, however, that if such record holder is a nominee, the\n\n               Class B Holder shall be the first person in the chain of\n\n               ownership of such share of Class B Common Stock who is not\n\n               holding such share solely as a nominee.\n\n\n\n                      (iv) The Corporation may, in connection with preparing a\n\nlist of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or as a\n\ncondition to the transfer or the registration of shares of Class B Common Stock\n\non the Corporation's books, or at any other time, require the furnishing of such\n\naffidavits or other proof as it deems necessary to establish that a Class B\n\nHolder is a Permitted Transferee. Upon the determination by the Board of\n\nDirectors of the Corporation or a committee thereof that a Class B Holder is not\n\na Permitted Transferee, each share of Class B Common Stock held by such Class B\n\nHolder shall thereupon be converted automatically into one (1) fully paid and\n\nnonassessable share of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the procedures set forth\n\nin Section 4.2(d)(iii).\n\n\n\n                        (v) Each certificate representing shares of Class B\n\nCommon Stock shall be endorsed with a legend that states that shares of Class B\n\nCommon Stock are not transferable other than to certain transferees and are\n\nsubject to certain restrictions as set forth in this Restated Certificate of\n\nIncorporation filed by the Corporation with the Secretary of State of the State\n\nof Delaware.\n\n\n\n                  (d) CONVERSION OF CLASS B COMMON STOCK.\n\n\n\n                        (i) If, on the record date for any meeting of\n\nstockholders of the Corporation, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock\n\nthen outstanding constitutes less than 10% of the aggregate number of shares of\n\nCommon Stock then outstanding, as determined by the Board of Directors of the\n\nCorporation, each share of Class B Common Stock then issued or outstanding shall\n\nthereupon be converted automatically as of such record date into one (1) fully\n\npaid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock and will have one vote per\n\nshare at such meeting. Upon making such determination, notice of such automatic\n\nconversion shall be given by the Corporation by means of a press release and\n\nwritten notice to all Class B Holders and\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nshall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than the next meeting of\n\nstockholders of the Corporation, and the Secretary of the Corporation shall be\n\ninstructed to, and shall promptly request from each Class B Holder that each\n\nholder promptly deliver, and each holder shall promptly deliver, the certificate\n\nrepresenting each such share of Class B Common Stock to the Corporation for\n\nexchange hereunder, together with instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory\n\nto the Corporation and Transfer Agent, duly executed by such holder or such\n\nholder's duly authorized attorney, and together with transfer tax stamps or\n\nfunds therefore, if required pursuant to Section 4.2(d)(vii).\n\n\n\n                      (ii) Each Class B Holder shall be entitled to convert, at\n\nany time and from time to time, any or all of the shares of such holder's Class\n\nB Common Stock, on a one-for-one basis, into the same number of fully paid and\n\nnonassessable shares of Class A Common Stock. Such right shall be exercised by\n\nthe surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of\n\nClass B Common Stock to be converted to the Corporation at any time during\n\nnormal business hours at the principal executive offices of the Corporation or\n\nat the office of the Transfer Agent, accompanied by a written notice of the\n\nholder of such shares stating that such holder desires to convert such shares,\n\nor a stated number of the shares represented by such certificate or\n\ncertificates, into an equal number of shares of the Class A Common Stock, and\n\n(if so required by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent) by instruments of\n\ntransfer, in form satisfactory to the corporation and to the Transfer Agent,\n\nduly executed by such holder or such holder's duly authorized attorney, and\n\ntransfer tax stamps or funds therefor, if required pursuant to Section\n\n4.2(d)(vii).\n\n\n\n                     (iii) As set forth in Section 4.2(c)(iv), upon the\n\ndetermination by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a committee\n\nthereof that a Class B Holder is not a Permitted Transferee, each share of Class\n\nB Common Stock, or any beneficial interest therein, held by such Class B Holder\n\nshall thereupon be converted automatically into one (1) fully paid and\n\nnonassessable share of Class A Common Stock. A determination by the Board of\n\nDirectors of the Corporation that a Class B Holder is not a Permitted Transferee\n\nand therefore a conversion is required shall be conclusive. Upon making such a\n\ndetermination, the Secretary of the Corporation shall be instructed to, and\n\nshall promptly request from the holder of record of each such share of Class B\n\nCommon Stock that each such holder promptly deliver, and each such holder shall\n\npromptly deliver, the certificate representing each such share of Class B Common\n\nStock to the Corporation for exchange hereunder, together with instruments of\n\ntransfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation and Transfer Agent, duly\n\nexecuted by such holder or such holder's duly authorized attorney, and together\n\nwith transfer tax stamps or funds therefore, if required pursuant to Section\n\n4.2(d)(vii).\n\n\n\n                      (iv) As promptly as practicable following the surrender\n\nfor conversion of a certificate representing shares of Class B Common Stock in\n\nthe manner provided in Section 4.2(d)(i), (ii) or (iii), as applicable, and the\n\npayment in cash of any amount required by the provisions of Section 4.2(d)(vii),\n\nthe Corporation will deliver or cause to be delivered at the office of the\n\nTransfer Agent, a certificate or certificates representing the number of full\n\nshares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, issued in such\n\nname or names as such holder may direct. In the case of a conversion\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nunder Section 4.2(d)(i), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on\n\nthe record date for such meeting of stockholders on which the condition set\n\nforth in Section 4.2(d)(i) is determined by the Board of Directors of the\n\nCorporation to have occurred. In the case of a conversion under Section\n\n4.2(d)(ii), such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately\n\nprior to the close of business on the date of the surrender of the certificate\n\nor certificates representing shares of Class B Common Stock. In the case of a\n\nconversion under Section 4.2(d)(iii), such conversion shall be deemed to have\n\nbeen made on the date of transfer. Upon the date any conversion under Section\n\n4.2(d)(i) is made or effected, all rights of the holder of such shares as such\n\nholder shall cease, and the person or persons in whose name or names the\n\ncertificate or certificates representing the shares of Class A Common Stock are\n\nto be issued shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record\n\nholder or holders of such shares of Class A Common Stock. Upon the date any\n\nconversion under Section 4.2(d)(ii) is made or effected, all rights of the\n\nholder of such shares as such holder shall cease, and the person or persons in\n\nwhose name or names the certificate or certificates representing the shares of\n\nClass A Common Stock are to be issued shall be treated for all purposes as\n\nhaving become the record holder or holders of such shares of Class A Common\n\nStock; provided, however, that if any such surrender and payment occurs on any\n\ndate when the stock transfer books of the Corporation shall be closed, the\n\nperson or persons in whose name or names the certificate or certificates\n\nrepresenting shares of Class A Common Stock are to be issued shall be deemed the\n\nrecord holder or holders thereof for all purposes immediately prior to the close\n\nof business on the next succeeding day on which the stock transfer books are\n\nopen. Upon the date any conversion under Section 4.2(d)(iii) is made, all rights\n\nof the holder of such shares as such holder shall cease, and the new owner or\n\nowners of such shares shall be treated for all purposes as having become the\n\nrecord holder or holders of such shares of Class A Common Stock.\n\n\n\n                        (v) In the event of a reclassification or other similar\n\ntransaction as a result of which the shares of Class A Common Stock are\n\nconverted into another security, then a Class B Holder shall be entitled to\n\nreceive upon conversion the amount of such security that such holder would have\n\nreceived if such conversion had occurred immediately prior to the record date of\n\nsuch reclassification or other similar transaction. No adjustments in respect of\n\ndividends shall be made upon the conversion of any share of Class B Common\n\nStock; provided, however, that if a share shall be converted subsequent to the\n\nrecord date for the payment of a dividend or other distribution on shares of\n\nClass B Common Stock but prior to such payment, then the registered holder of\n\nsuch share at the close of business on such record date shall be entitled to\n\nreceive the dividend or other distribution payable on such share on such date\n\nnotwithstanding the conversion thereof or the Corporation's default in payment\n\nof the dividend due on such date.\n\n\n\n                      (vi) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times\n\nreserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A\n\nCommon Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon conversion of the\n\noutstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, such number of shares of Class A\n\nCommon Stock that shall be issuable upon the conversion of all such outstanding\n\nshares of Class B Common Stock; provided, that, nothing contained herein shall\n\nbe construed to preclude the Corporation from satisfying its obligations in\n\nrespect of the conversion of the outstanding shares of Class B Common\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nStock by delivery of purchased shares of Class A Common Stock which are held in\n\nthe treasury of the Corporation.
