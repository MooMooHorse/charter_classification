In the\n\n         event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on\n\n         the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a\n\n         subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares\n\n         of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a\n\n         dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of\n\n         shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which\n\n         holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately\n\n         prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be\n\n         adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of\n\n         which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately\n\n         after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares\n\n         of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n                  (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution\n\n         on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this\n\n         Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the\n\n         Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock);\n\n         provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been\n\n         declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly\n\n         Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend\n\n         Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share on the Series A Preferred\n\n         Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly\n\n         Dividend Payment Date.\n\n\n\n                  (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on\n\n         outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly\n\n         Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares,\n\n         unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for\n\n         the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on\n\n         such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such\n\n         shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment\n\n         Date or is\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\n<PAGE>   5\n\n         a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares\n\n         of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend\n\n         and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which\n\n         events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such\n\n         Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not\n\n         bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\n         in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time\n\n         accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a\n\n         share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The\n\n         Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of\n\n         holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive\n\n         payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record\n\n         date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the\n\n         payment thereof.\n\n\n\n         (c) Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nshall have the following voting rights:\n\n\n\n                  (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set\n\n         forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder\n\n         thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the\n\n         stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at\n\n         any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in\n\n         shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or\n\n         consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by\n\n         reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares\n\n         of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common\n\n         Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which\n\n         holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately\n\n         prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a\n\n         fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common\n\n         Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of\n\n         which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding\n\n         immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n                  (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other\n\n         Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any\n\n         similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred\n\n         Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital\n\n         stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote\n\n         together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of\n\n         stockholders of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n                  (C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by\n\n         law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting\n\n         rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent\n\n         they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth\n\n         herein) for taking any corporate action.\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\n<PAGE>   6\n\n         (d)  Certain Restrictions.\n\n\n\n                  (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or\n\n         distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in\n\n         Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid\n\n         dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of\n\n         Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the\n\n         Corporation shall not:\n\n\n\n                           (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other\n\n                  distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either\n\n                  as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding\n\n                  up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\n\n\n                           (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other\n\n                  distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity\n\n                  (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or\n\n                  winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except\n\n                  dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all\n\n                  such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears\n\n                  in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all\n\n                  such shares are then entitled;\n\n\n\n                           (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for\n\n                  consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to\n\n                  dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to\n\n                  the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation\n\n                  may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares\n\n                  of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock\n\n                  of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or\n\n                  upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A\n\n                  Preferred Stock;

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.\n\n(a) Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is\n\nthreatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or\n\nproceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative\n\n(hereinafter a \"proceeding\"), by reason of the fact that such person, or a\n\nperson of whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or\n\nofficer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the\n\nCorporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or\n\nof a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service\n\nwith respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is\n\nalleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent\n\nor in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or\n\nagent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest\n\nextent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended\n\n(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment\n\npermits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law\n\npermitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all\n\nexpense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,\n\namounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising\n\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as in effect from\n\ntime to time) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection\n\ntherewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased\n\nto be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of\n\nsuch person's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that,\n\nexcept as provided in paragraph (b) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any\n\nsuch person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part\n\nthereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was\n\nauthorized by the Board. The right to\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\n<PAGE>   12\n\nindemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall\n\ninclude the right to have the Corporation pay the expenses incurred in defending\n\nany such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; any advance payments to\n\nbe paid by the Corporation within 20 calendar days after the receipt by the\n\nCorporation of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such\n\nadvance or advances from time to time; provided, however, that, if and to the\n\nextent the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or\n\nofficer in such person's capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other\n\ncapacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or\n\nofficer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in\n\nadvance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon\n\ndelivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director\n\nor officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be\n\ndetermined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under\n\nthis Section or otherwise. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from\n\ntime to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and\n\nrights to have the Corporation pay the expenses incurred in defending any\n\nproceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the\n\nCorporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect\n\nto the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of\n\nthe Corporation.\n\n\n\n(b) Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under paragraph (a) of this\n\nSection is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 calendar days after a\n\nwritten claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time\n\nthereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of\n\nthe claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled\n\nto be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to\n\nany such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses\n\nincurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where\n\nthe required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the\n\nCorporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes\n\nit permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for\n\nthe amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the\n\nCorporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of\n\nDirectors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a\n\ndetermination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of\n\nthe claimant is proper in the circumstances because the claimant has met the\n\napplicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual\n\ndetermination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent\n\nlegal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such\n\napplicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a\n\npresumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.\n\n\n\n(c) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment of\n\nexpenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition\n\nconferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any\n\nperson may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the\n\nCertificate of Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or\n\ndisinterested directors or otherwise. No repeal or modification of this Article\n\nshall in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\n<PAGE>   13\n\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation hereunder in respect of\n\nany occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.\n\n\n\n(d) Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to\n\nprotect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation\n\nor another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise\n\nagainst any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation\n\nwould have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or\n\nloss under the DGCL.\n\n\n\n(e) Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Article X shall be held\n\nto be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the\n\nvalidity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this\n\nArticle X (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this\n\nArticle X containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or\n\nunenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)\n\nshall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2) to the fullest\n\nextent possible, the provisions of this Article X (including, without\n\nlimitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article X containing any\n\nsuch provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed\n\nso as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid,\n\nillegal or unenforceable.\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\n</TEXT>\n\n", "completion": {"answer": "Y", "reference": ["SECTION 1.
