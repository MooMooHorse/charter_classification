The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by\n\njudgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of NOLO CONTENDERE or its\n\nequivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not\n\nact in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not\n\nopposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any\n\ncriminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct\n\nwas unlawful.

INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES OF SUCCESSFUL PARTY. Notwithstanding\n\nthe other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been\n\nsuccessful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or\n\nproceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article, or in defense of any\n\nclaim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or\n\nproceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys'\n\nfees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection\n\ntherewith.

As a condition precedent to his\n\nright to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing\n\nas soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation\n\ninvolving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any\n\naction, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so\n\nnotified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own\n\nexpense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal\n\ncounsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the\n\nCorporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the\n\nCorporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other\n\nexpenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim,\n\nother than as provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall have the\n\nright to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and\n\nexpenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its\n\nassumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee\n\nunless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by\n\nthe Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded\n\nthat there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue\n\nbetween the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such\n\naction or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to\n\nassume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses\n\nof counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except\n\nas otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be\n\nentitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any\n\nclaim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for\n\nthe Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause\n\n(ii) above.\n\n\n\n         5. ADVANCE OF EXPENSES. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 below,\n\nin the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to\n\nSection 4 of this Article of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of\n\nwhich the Corporation receives notice under this Article, any expenses\n\n(including attorneys' fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or\n\ncriminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall\n\nbe paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter;\n\nPROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the payment of such expense incurred by an Indemnitee in\n\nadvance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt\n\nof an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so\n\nadvanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee\n\nis not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this\n\nArticle. Such undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial\n\nability of the Indemnitee to make such repayment.\n\n\n\n         6. PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION. In order to obtain indemnification or\n\nadvancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the\n\nIndemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such\n\nrequest such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the\n\nIndemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent\n\nthe Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any\n\nsuch indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in\n\nany event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request\n\nof the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the\n\nCorporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day\n\nperiod that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set\n\nforth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in\n\neach instance by (a) a majority vote of a quorum of the directors of the\n\nCorporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the\n\naction, suit or proceeding in question (\"disinterested directors\"), (b) if no\n\nsuch quorum is obtainable, a majority vote of a committee of two or more\n\ndisinterested directors, (c) a majority vote of\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\n<PAGE>   6\n\n\n\na quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for\n\ndirectors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders\n\nwho are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question,\n\n(c) independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the\n\nCorporation), or (d) a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n         7. REMEDIES. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by\n\nthis Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent\n\njurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if\n\nno disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred to above in\n\nSection 6. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the\n\nIndemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advance of expenses under this\n\nArticle shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to\n\nhave made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that\n\nindemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met\n\nthe applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the\n\nCorporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such\n\napplicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a\n\npresumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.\n\nThe Indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection\n\nwith successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in\n\npart, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.\n\n\n\n         8. SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENT. No amendment, termination or repeal of this\n\nArticle or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware\n\nor any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of\n\nany Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to\n\nany action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any\n\nactions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such\n\namendment, termination or repeal.\n\n\n\n         9. OTHER RIGHTS. The indemnification and advancement of expenses\n\nprovided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to\n\nwhich an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be\n\nentitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders\n\nor disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official\n\ncapacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the\n\nCorporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a\n\ndirector or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs,\n\nexecutors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this\n\nArticle shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically\n\nauthorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing\n\nindemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this\n\nArticle. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to\n\ntime by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees\n\nor agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such\n\nrights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this\n\nArticle.\n\n\n\n         10. PARTIAL INDEMNIFICATION. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any\n\nprovision of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a\n\nportion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts\n\npaid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in\n\nconnection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal,\n\ntherefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall\n\nnevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses\n\n(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to\n\nwhich the Indemnitee is entitled.\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\n<PAGE>   7\n\n\n\n         11. INSURANCE. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at\n\nits expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of\n\nthe Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or\n\nother enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense,\n\nliability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his\n\nstatus as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify\n\nsuch person against such expense, liability or loss under the General\n\nCorporation law of Delaware.\n\n\n\n         12. MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION. If the Corporation is merged into or\n\nconsolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving\n\ncorporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the\n\nCorporation under this Article with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or\n\ninvestigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts\n\noccurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.\n\n\n\n         13. SAVINGS CLAUSE. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be\n\ninvalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the\n\nCorporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses\n\n(including attorneys' fees) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in\n\nconnection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,\n\ncriminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the\n\nCorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this\n\nArticle that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted\n\nby applicable law.\n\n\n\n         14. DEFINITIONS. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and\n\nSection 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall have the\n\nrespective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section\n\n145(i).\n\n\n\n         15. SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION. If the General Corporation Law of Delaware\n\nis amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification\n\npermitted to Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to\n\nthe fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as so\n\namended.\"\n\n\n\n         TENTH. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or\n\nrepeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in\n\nthe manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute and this Restated Certificate\n\nof Incorporation, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted\n\nsubject to this reservation.\n\n\n\n         ELEVENTH.
