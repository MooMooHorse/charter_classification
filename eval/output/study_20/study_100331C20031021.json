They are the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, respectively, of\n\n20th  Century  Industries,  a  California  corporation.\n\n\n\n     2.     Article  IV  of  the  Articles of Incorporation is hereby amended to\n\nread  in  full  as  follows:\n\n\n\n                                       IV\n\n\n\n          This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of shares to be\n\n     designated respectively \"Preferred Shares\" and \"Common Shares\" the total\n\n     number of shares which this corporation has authority to issue is\n\n     110,500,000 and the aggregate per value of all shares that arc to have a\n\n     par value shall be $500,000; the number of Preferred Shares that are to\n\n     have a per value shall be 500,000 and the par value of each share of such\n\n     class shall be $1 and the number of Common Shares without per value shall\n\n     be 110,000,000.

In case the number of shares of any series shall\n\n     be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the\n\n     status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally\n\n     fixing the number of shares of such series.\n\n\n\n     3.     Articles  V,  VI,  VII and VIII of the Articles of Incorporation are\n\nhereby  renumbered  as  Articles  VI,  VII,  VIII  and  IX,  respectively.\n\n\n\n     4.     A  new  Article  V is hereby added to the Articles of Incorporation,\n\nwhich  shall  read  in  full  as  follows:\n\n\n\n                                        V\n\n\n\n          A.   Prohibited Transfer; Excess Stock. Except as provided in\n\n     Section G, until the Restriction Termination Date, any attempted direct or\n\n     indirect Transfer of Stock shall be deemed a \"Prohibited Transfer\" if (i)\n\n     such Transfer would increase the Percentage of Stock Owned by any Person\n\n     that (or by any Person whose Stock is or by virtue of such Transfer would\n\n     be attributed to any Person that), either after giving effect to the\n\n     attribution rules (including the option attribution rules) of Section 382\n\n     or without regard to such attribution rules, Owns, by virtue of such\n\n     Transfer would Own, a has any time since the period beginning three years\n\n     prior to the date of such Transfer Owned, Stock in excess of the Limit,\n\n     (ii) such Transfer would increase the Percentage of Stock Owned by any 5%\n\n     Shareholder (including but not limited to a Transfer that results in the\n\n     creation of a 5% Shareholder), or (iii) such Transfer would cause an\n\n     \"ownership change\" of the corporation within the meaning of Section 382.\n\n     Except as otherwise provided in Sections D and F, the Stock or Option\n\n     sought to be Transferred in the Prohibited Transfer shall be deemed \"Excess\n\n     Stock.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n          B.   Transfer of Excess Stock to Trustee. Except as otherwise\n\n     provided in Sections D and F, a Prohibited Transfer shall be void and o as\n\n     to the Purported Transferee in the Prohibited Transfer and such Purported\n\n     Transferee shall not be recognized as the owner of the Excess Stock for any\n\n     purpose and shall not be entitled to any rights as a stockholder of the\n\n     corporation arising from the ownership of Excess Stock, including, but not\n\n     limited to, the right to vote such Excess Stock or to receive dividends or\n\n     other distributions in respect thereof or, in the case of Options, to\n\n     receive Stock in respect of their exercise. Any Excess Stock shall\n\n     automatically be transferred to the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the\n\n     Charitable Beneficiary, effective as of the close of business on the\n\n     business day prior to the date of the Prohibited Transfer; provided,\n\n     however, that if the transfer to the trust is deemed ineffective for any\n\n     reason, such Excess Stock shall nevertheless be deemed to have been\n\n     automatically transferred to the person selected as the Trustee at such\n\n     time, and such person shall have rights consistent with those of the\n\n     Trustee as described in this section and in Section C below. Any dividend\n\n     or other distribution with respect to such Excess Stock paid prior to the\n\n     discovery by the corporation that the Excess Stock has been transferred to\n\n     the Trustee (\"Prohibited Distributions) shall be deemed to be held by the\n\n     Purported Transferee as agent for the Trustee, and shall be paid to the\n\n     Trustee upon demand, and any dividend or distribution declared but unpaid\n\n     shall be paid when due to the Trustee. Any vote cast by a Purported\n\n     Transferee with respect to Excess Stock prior to the discovery by the\n\n     corporation that the Excess Stock has been transferred to the Trustee will\n\n     be rescinded as void and shall be recast in accordance with the desires of\n\n     the Trustee acting far the sole benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The\n\n     Purported Transferee and any other Person holding certificates representing\n\n     Excess Stock shall immediately surrender such certificates to the Trustee.\n\n     The Trustee shall have all the rights of the owner of the Excess Stock,\n\n     including the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions,\n\n     and to receive proceeds from liquidation, which rights shall be exercised\n\n     for the sole benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary.\n\n\n\n          C.   Disposition of Excess Stock. As soon as practicable\n\n     following receipt of notice from the corporation that Excess Stock has been\n\n     transferred to the Trustee, due Trustee shall take such actions as it deems\n\n     necessary to dispose of the Excess Stock in an arm's- length transaction\n\n     that would not constitute a Prohibited Transfer. Upon the disposition of\n\n     much Excess Stock, (i) the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the\n\n     Excess Stock shall terminate, and (ii) the Trustee shall distribute the net\n\n     proceeds of the sale as follows: (a) the Purported Transferee shall receive\n\n     an amount of the net proceeds of such series not to exceed the Purported\n\n     Transferee's costs incurred to acquire such Excess Stock, or, if such\n\n     Excess Stock was Transferred for less than fair market value, the fair\n\n     market value of the Excess Stock on the date of the Prohibited Transfer, in\n\n     each case less all costs incurred by the corporation, the Trustee and the\n\n     Transfer Agent in enforcing the Restrictions, and (b) the Charitable\n\n     Beneficiary shall receive the balance of the net proceeds from the sale of\n\n     the Excess Stock, if any, together with any Prohibited Distributions\n\n     received from the Purported Transferee and any, other distributions with\n\n     respect to such Excess Stock while such Stock was held by the Trustee. In\n\n     the event the Purported Transferee has disposed of the Excess, Stock and\n\n     distributed the proceeds and other amounts otherwise than in accordance\n\n     with this section, then (w) such Purported Transferee shall be deemed to\n\n     have disposed of such Excess Stock as an agent for the Trustee, (x) such\n\n     Purported Transferee shall be deemed to hold such proceeds and any\n\n     Prohibited Distributions as an agent for the Trustee, (y) such Purported\n\n     Transferee shall be required to return to the Trustee the proceeds from\n\n     such sale, together with any Prohibited Distributions theretofore received\n\n     by the Purported Transferee with respect to such Excess Stock, provided\n\n     that upon receipt of written permission from the Trustee, the Purported\n\n     Transferee will be entitled to retain an amount of such sale proceeds not\n\n     to exceed the amount that such Purported Transferee would have received\n\n     from the Trustee if the Trustee had obtained and resold the Excess Stock at\n\n     any time during the period beginning on the date of the Prohibited Transfer\n\n     giving rise to such Excess Stock and ending on date of such disposition by\n\n\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n     the Purported Transferee, assuming for this purpose that the Trustee would\n\n     have sold the Excess Stock for an amount equal to the lowest-quoted trading\n\n     price of such Excess Stock during such period, and (a) the trustee shall\n\n     transfer any remaining proceeds to the Charitable Beneficiary. Neither the\n\n     Trustee, the corporation, the Purported Transferee nor any other party\n\n     shall claim an income tax deduction with respect to any transfer to the\n\n     Charitable Beneficiary and neither the Trustee nor the corporation shall\n\n     benefit In any way from the enforcement of the Restrictions, except insofar\n\n     as these restrictions to protect the corporation's Income Tax Net Operating\n\n     Loss Carryover. Neither the Trustee, the corporation nor the Transfer Agent\n\n     shall have any liability to any Person for any loss arising from or related\n\n     to a Prohibited Transfer.\n\n\n\n          D.   Transfers by 5% Shareholders. In the event a Prohibited\n\n     Transfer is attributable to a Transfer by a 5% Shareholder, the corporation\n\n     and the Transfer Agent shall make all reasonable efforts to locate the\n\n     Person or Public Group who acquired the Excess Stock (the Public\n\n     Purchaser). In the event the corporation is able to locate the Public\n\n     Purchaser within ninety (90) days of the Prohibited Transfer, the\n\n     corporation shall request that the Public Purchaser surrender the Excess\n\n     Stock, together with any dividends or other distributions theretofore\n\n     received with respect to the Excess Stock by the Public Publisher, to the\n\n     Purported Transferor, and, if such Stock is surrendered, the Public\n\n     Publisher shall surrender to the Public Publisher the purchase price paid\n\n     by the Public Purchaser for the Excess Stock, plus, if the Public Purchaser\n\n     acquired Ownership of due Excess Stock without knowledge that such\n\n     acquisition was a Prohibited Transfer, an amount equal to all other losses,\n\n     damages, costs and expenses incurred by the Public Purchaser to acquire\n\n     Ownership of the Excess Stock and to comply with the Restrictions\n\n     (including any loss incurred as a remit of a decline in value of such\n\n     Stock). In the event the Transfer Agent and the corporation are unable to\n\n     locate due Public Purchaser within ninety (90) days following the\n\n     Prohibited Transfer, or the Public Purchaser refuses to surrender or has\n\n     disposed of the Excess Stock prior to the surrender of the Excess Stock to\n\n     the Purported Transferor, such Stock shall no longer be treated as Excess\n\n     Stock and due corporation shall (i) purchase from one or more third\n\n     parties, in one or more transactions that would, to the extent possible,\n\n     reduce the Ownership of Stock by the Person or Public Group whose Ownership\n\n     increased as a result of the Prohibited Transfer to an amount equal to such\n\n     Ownership immediately prior to the Prohibited Transfer, shares of Stock\n\n     equal in type and number to the Stock Transferred in the Prohibited\n\n     Transfer (which Stock shall be treated as Excess Stock), (ii) hold such\n\n     Stock for and on behalf of the Purported Transferor, (iii) treat such Stock\n\n     as Owned by the Purported Transferor since the date of the Prohibited\n\n     Transfer for all purposes, including the right to vote and to receive\n\n     dividends and other distributions, and (iv) for all purposes treat any\n\n     dividends and other distributions made to such Person or Public Group as a\n\n     dividend or other distribution to the Purported Transferor, a payment by\n\n     the Purported Transferor to the corporation to be applied against the\n\n     Amount Due (as defined below), and a non-dividend payment to the Persons or\n\n     Public Group who received such distributions. To the extent reasonably\n\n     possible, any votes cast by such Person or Public Group from and after the\n\n     date of the Prohibited Transfer with respect to Excess Stock shall be\n\n     rescinded in the same proportion as the votes actually cast by such Person\n\n     or Public Group, and the Purported Transferor shall be entitled to cast\n\n     those votes that were rescinded. The corporation shall hold such Excess\n\n     Stock, and any dividends or other distributions thereon, on behalf of the\n\n     Purported Transferor, as security for payment of the Amount Due, until the\n\n     earlier of such the as (y) the corporation has received, either directly\n\n     from the Purported Transferor or indirectly from any dividends or other\n\n     distributions theretofore received by the corporation with respect to such\n\n     Excess Stock on behalf of the Purported Transferor (or any amounts deemed\n\n     paid by the Purported Transferor as provided in this Section D), or any\n\n     combination thereof, an amount equal to the amount incurred by the\n\n     corporation to fund the purchase such Excess Stock plus all costs incurred\n\n     by the corporation in enforcing due Restrictions with respect to such\n\n     Prohibited Transfer (including the amount of any non dividend payment\n\n     deemed made by the corporation to the Person or Public Group as provided in\n\n     this Section D), plus interest on all such amounts from the dates incurred\n\n     by the corporation at the \"applicable federal rate\" detrained under Section\n\n     1274(d) of the Code (collectively, the \"Amount Due\") (it being the intent\n\n     to treat the Amount Due and any portion thereof as a loan to the Purported\n\n     Transferor), or (z) the corporation is able to dispose of such Excess Stock\n\n     on behalf of the Purported Transferor in a transaction that would not be a\n\n     Prohibited Transfer, in which case the corporation will sell such Excess\n\n     Stock and distribute to the Purported Transferor any proceeds (together\n\n     with any other cash distributions theretofore received (or deemed received)\n\n     with respect to the Exams Stock) in excess of the Amount Due. The\n\n     obligation of the Purported Transferor for the Amount Due shall be payable\n\n     on demand by the corporation. In the event the Amount Due exceeds the\n\n     proceeds from & a sale of Excess Stock and any cash distributions\n\n     theretofore received (or deemed received) by the corporation on behalf of\n\n     the Purported Transferor with respect to such Excess Stock, the balance\n\n     shall be due from the Purported Transferor on demand.\n\n\n\n          E.   Transfer Agent's Rights and Responsibilities. The Transfer\n\n     Agent shall not register any Transfer of Stock on the corporation's stock\n\n     transfer records if it has knowledge that such Transfer is a Prohibited\n\n     Transfer. The Transfer Agent shall have the right, prior and as a condition\n\n     to registering any Transfer of Stock on the corporation's stock transfer\n\n     records, to request any transferee of the Stock to submit an affidavit, on\n\n     a form agreed to by the Transfer Agent and the corporation, stating the\n\n     number of shares of each class of Stock Owned by the transferee (and by\n\n     Persons who would Own the transferees Stock) before the proposed Transfer\n\n     and that would, if effect were given to the proposed Transfer, be Owned by\n\n     the transferee (and by Persons who would Own the prospective transferee's\n\n     Stock) after the proposed Transfer. If either (i) the Transfer Agent does\n\n     not receive such affidavit, or (ii) such affidavit evidences that the\n\n     Transfer was a prohibited Transfer, the Transfer Agent shall notify the\n\n     corporation and shall not take enter the Prohibited Transfer into the\n\n     corporation's stock transfer records, and the Trustee, the corporation and\n\n     the Transfer Agent shall take such steps as provided in the Restrictions in\n\n     order to dispose of the Excess Stock purportedly Owned by such Purported\n\n     Transferee. If the Transfer Agent, for whatever reason, enters a Prohibited\n\n     Transfer in the corporation stock transfer records, such Transfer shall be\n\n     nonetheless void and shall have no force and effect, in accordance with the\n\n     Restrictions, and the corporation's stock transfer records shall be revised\n\n     to so provide.\n\n\n\n          F.   Certain Indirect Prohibited Transfers. In the event a\n\n     Transfer would be a Prohibited Transfer as a result of attribution to the\n\n     Purported Transferee of the Ownership of Stock by a Person (an \"Other\n\n     Person') who is non controlling, controlled by or under common control with\n\n     the Purported Transferee, which Ownership is nevertheless attributed to the\n\n     Purported Transferee, the Restrictions shall not apply in a manner that\n\n     would invalidate any Transfer to such Other Person, and the Purported\n\n     Transferee and any Persons controlling, controlled by or under common\n\n     control with the Purported Transferee (collectively, the \"Purported\n\n     Transferee Group) shall automatically be deemed to have transferred to the\n\n     Trustee at the time and in a manner consistent with Section B hereof,\n\n     sufficient Stock (which Stock shall (i) consist only of Stock held legally\n\n     or beneficially, whether directly or indirectly, by any member of the\n\n     Purported Transferee Group, but not Stock held through any Other Person,\n\n     other than shares held through a Person acting as agent or fiduciary for\n\n     any member of the Purported Transfers Group, (ii) be deemed transferred to\n\n     the Trustee, in the inverse order in which it was acquired by members of\n\n     the Purported Transferee Group, and (iii) be treated as Excess Stock) to\n\n     cause the Purported Transferee, following such transfer to the Trustee, not\n\n     to be in violation of the Restrictions; provided, however, that to the\n\n     extent the foregoing provisions of this Section F would not be effective to\n\n\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n     prevent a Prohibited Transfer, the Restrictions shall apply to such other\n\n     Stock Owned by the Purported Transferee (including Stock actually owned by\n\n     Other Persons), in a manner designed to minimize the amount of Stock\n\n     subject to the Restrictions or as otherwise determined by the Board of\n\n     Directors to be necessary to prevent a Prohibited Transfer (which Stock\n\n     shall be treated as Excess Stock).\n\n\n\n          G.   Exceptions. The term \"Prohibited Transfer\" shall not\n\n     include: (i) he original issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\n\n     pursuant to the Investment Agreement, (ii) the original issuance of Series\n\n     A Warrants pursuant to the Investment Agreement, (iii) the conversion of\n\n     Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, (iv) the sale of Series A Convertible\n\n     Preferred Stock or Common Shares acquired upon the conversion thereof if\n\n     the series would not be a Prohibited Transfer but for the transferor's\n\n     ownership of Stock, in either case in compliance with the Investment\n\n     Agreement, (v) any purchase of Stock permitted by Section 6.1(b) of the\n\n     Investment Agreement, (vi) any series of any securities of the corporation\n\n     acquired pursuant to the Investment Agreement after the Restriction\n\n     Effective Date if such acquisition was not prohibited pursuant to the terms\n\n     of the Investment Agreement, (vii) any Transfer described lit Section\n\n     382(1)(3)(B) of the Code (relating to transfers upon death or divorce and\n\n     certain gifts) if all Persons who would Own the Stock Transferred would be\n\n     treated for purposes of Section 382 as having Owned such Stock at all times\n\n     beginning more than three (3) years prior to the date of the Transfer,\n\n     (viii) any series of Common Stock by a Person who 0mm more than 4.75% of\n\n     the outstanding Common Stock on November 15, 1994 if such sale would not\n\n     result in a net increase in the amount of Stock owned by 5% Shareholders\n\n     during the three-year period ending on the date of such series, provided\n\n     such sale would not otherwise be prohibited under the Restrictions but for\n\n     such transferor's Ownership of Stock, and (ix) any Transfer with respect to\n\n     which the Person who would otherwise be the Purported Transferee obtains or\n\n     is granted the prior written approval of the Board of Directors of the\n\n     corporation, which approval shall be granted in its sole and absolute\n\n     discretion after considering all facts and circumstances, including but not\n\n     limited to future events the occurrence of which are deemed by the Board of\n\n     Directors of the corporation to be reasonably possible.\n\n\n\n          H.   Legend. All certificates or other instruments evidencing\n\n     Ownership of Stock shall bear a conspicuous legend describing the\n\n     restrictions. The Board of Directors shall take such actions as it deems\n\n     necessary to substitute certificates evidencing ownership of Stock and\n\n     bearing such legend for certificates not baring such legend.\n\n\n\n          I.   Prompt Enforcement; Further Actions. As soon as practicable\n\n     and within thirty (30) business days of learning of a purported Prohibited\n\n     Transfer, the corporation through its Secretary or any assistant Secretary\n\n     shall demand that the Purported Transferee (or any other member of the\n\n     Purported Transferee Group) or Public Purchaser surrender to the Trustee\n\n     the certificates representing the Excess Stock or any resale proceeds\n\n     therefrom, and any Prohibited Distributions or other dividends or\n\n     distributions received thereon, and if such surrender is not made within\n\n     twenty (20) business days from the date of such demand, the corporation\n\n     shall institute legal proceedings to compel such surrender and for\n\n     compensatory damages on account of any failure to take such actions;\n\n     provided. however, that nothing in this Section I shall preclude the\n\n     corporation in its discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings\n\n     without a prior demand, and also provided that failure of the corporation\n\n     to act within the time periods set out in this section shall not constitute\n\n     a waiver of any right of the corporation to compel any transfer required\n\n     hereby. Upon a determination by the Board of Directors that then has been\n\n     or is threatened a Prohibited Transfer, the Board of Directors may\n\n     authorize such additional action as it deems advisable to give effect to\n\n\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n     the Restrictions, including, without limitation, refusing to give effect on\n\n     the books of the Company to any such purported Prohibited Transfer or\n\n     instituting proceedings to enjoin any such purported Prohibited Transfer.\n\n     Nothing contained in the Restrictions shall limit the authority of the\n\n     Board of Directors to take such other action to the extent permitted by law\n\n     as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the corporation and the\n\n     Interests of the holders of its securities in preserving the Income Tax Net\n\n     Operating Loss Carryover, including, but not limited to, refusing to give\n\n     effect to any Prohibited Transfer or other action on the books of the\n\n     corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin any Prohibited Transfer or\n\n     other action; provided, however, that any Prohibited Transfer shall\n\n     nevertheless result in the consequences otherwise described in the\n\n     Restrictions.\n\n\n\n          J.   Board Authority to Interpret. The Board of Directors shall\n\n     have the authority to interpret the provisions of the Restrictions for the\n\n     purpose of protecting the Income Tax Net Operating Loss Carryover. Any such\n\n     interpretation shall be final and binding on any Person or Public Group who\n\n     Owns or purports to acquire Ownership of Stock.\n\n\n\n          K.   Damages. Any person who knowingly violates the Restrictions,\n\n     and any persons controlling, controlled by or under common control with\n\n     such a person, shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation\n\n     for, and shall indemnify & and hold the corporation harmless against, any\n\n     and all damages suffered as a result of such violation, branding but not\n\n     limited to damages resulting from a reduction In or elimination of the\n\n     corporations ability to utilize its Income Tax Net Operating Loss\n\n     Carryover, and attorneys' and accountants' fees incurred in connection with\n\n     such violation.\n\n\n\n          L.   Severability. If any part of the Restrictions is judicially\n\n     determined to be invalid on otherwise unenforceable, such invalidity or\n\n     unenforceable shall not affect the remainder of the Restrictions, which\n\n     shall be thereafter interpreted as if the invalid or unenforceable part\n\n     were not contained herein, and, to the maximum extent possible, in a manner\n\n     consistent with preserving the ability of the corporation to utilize to the\n\n     greatest extent possible the Income Tax Net Operating Loss Carryover.\n\n\n\n          M.   Effects on Stock Exchange Transactions. Nothing in the\n\n     Restrictions shall preclude the settlement of a transaction entered into\n\n     through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange. The Stock that is\n\n     the subject of such transaction shall continue to be subject to the terms\n\n     of the Restrictions after such settlement.\n\n\n\n          N.
