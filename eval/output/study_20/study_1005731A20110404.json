If the Corporation shall in any manner subdivide, combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Class A Stock or Common Stock, the outstanding shares of the other such class of common stock shall be subdivided, combined or \n\n\n\nreclassified proportionately in the same manner and on the same basis as the outstanding shares of Class A Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, have been subdivided, combined or reclassified. \n\n \n\n(d) Optional Conversion. \n\n \n\n(1) The shares of Common Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class A Stock or any other shares or securities of the Corporation. \n\n \n\n(2) Each share of Class A Stock may be converted, at any time and at the option of the holder thereof, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock. \n\n \n\n(e) Mandatory Conversion. \n\n \n\n(1) Upon a Transfer by a Holder, other than to a \u201cPermitted Transferee\u201d of such Holder, shares of Class A Stock so transferred shall, effective on the date of such Transfer, be automatically converted, without further act on anyone\u2019s part, into an equal number of shares of Common Stock, and the stock certificates formerly representing such shares of Class A Stock shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to represent the like number of shares of Common Stock. \n\n \n\n(2) For purposes of this Section 2(e): \n\n \n\nA \u201cPermitted Transferee\u201d of a Holder shall mean, the following: \n\n \n\n(i) In the case of any Holder, the Corporation or any one or more of its directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries;

provided that such trust may include a general or special power of appointment for such Holder or Family Members (a \u201cTrust\u201d); provided, further, that if by reason of any change in the beneficiaries of such Trust, such Trust would not have qualified, at the time of the Transfer of Class A Stock to such Trust (for purposes of this sub-paragraph (B), the \u201cTransfer Date\u201d), as a Permitted Transferee, all shares of Class A Stock so transferred to such Trust shall, effective on the date of such change of beneficiary, be automatically converted, without further act on anyone\u2019s part, into an equal number of shares of Common Stock, and the stock certificates formerly representing such shares of Class A Stock shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to represent the like number of shares of Common Stock;

The relationship of any person that is derived by or through legal adoption shall be considered a natural relationship. \n\n \n\nEach joint owner of shares or owner of a community property interest in shares of Class A Stock shall be considered a \u201cHolder\u201d of such shares. A minor for whom shares of Class A Stock are held pursuant to a Uniform Transfer to Minors Act or similar law shall be considered a Holder of such shares. \n\n \n\nAs used in this Section 2(e), a \u201cTransfer\u201d shall mean any type of transfer of shares of Class A Stock, whether by sale, exchange, gift, operation of law, pledge, or otherwise, and shares of Class A Stock shall refer to either (i) such shares of Class A Stock so transferred, (ii) the power to vote such shares so transferred or (iii) shares of Class A Stock for which the power to vote was so transferred, as the case may be. \n\n \n\n(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, any Holder may pledge the shares of Class A Stock belonging to such Holder to a pledgee pursuant to a bona fide pledge of such shares as collateral security for indebtedness due to the pledgee, provided that such pledgee does not have the power to vote such shares and such shares remain subject to the provisions of this Section.

Each certificate representing shares of Class A Stock shall be endorsed with a legend that states that shares of Class A Stock are not transferable other than to certain transferees and are subject to certain restrictions as set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation filed with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. \n\n \n\n(6) This Section 2(e) may not be amended without the affirmative vote of holders of the majority of the shares of Class A Stock and the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the shares of Common Stock, each voting separately as a class. \n\n \n\n(f) Conversion Procedures.\n\n \n\n(1) Each conversion of shares pursuant to Section 2(d) hereto will be effected by the surrender of the certificate or certificates, duly endorsed, representing the shares to be converted at the principal office of the transfer agent of the Class A Stock at any time during normal business hours, together with a written notice by the holder stating the number of shares that such holder desires to convert and the names or name in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for the Common Stock to be issued. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which such certificate or certificates have been surrendered, and at such time, the rights of any such holder with respect to the converted shares of such holder will cease and the person or persons in whose name \n\n\n\nor names the certificate or certificates for shares are to be issued upon such conversion will be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of such shares represented thereby. \n\n \n\nPromptly after such surrender, the Corporation will issue and deliver in accordance with the surrendering holder\u2019s instructions the certificate or certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion and a certificate representing any Class A Stock which was represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to the Corporation in connection with such conversion, but which was not converted. \n\n \n\n(2) The issuance of certificates upon conversion of shares pursuant to Section 2(d) hereto will be made without charge to the holder or holders of such shares for any issuance tax (except stock transfer tax) in respect thereof or other costs incurred by the Corporation in connection therewith. \n\n \n\n(3) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or its treasury shares, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the conversion of the Class A Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock as may be issued upon conversion of all outstanding Class A Stock. \n\n \n\n(4) Shares of the Class A Stock surrendered for conversion as above provided or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be cancelled according to law and shall not be reissued. \n\n \n\n(5) All shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of shares of Class A Stock will, upon issue, be fully paid and nonassessable. \n\n \n\nFIFTH: The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than three (3) and not more than fifteen (15) directors, the exact number of which shall initially be fixed by the Incorporator and thereafter from time to time by the Board of Directors. The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class of directors shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. The initial term of office of directors of Class I shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 1996; the initial term of office of directors of Class II shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 1997; and the initial term of office of directors of Class III shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 1998. At each annual meeting of stockholders, beginning with the annual meeting in 1996, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at such annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death or incapacity, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. \n\n \n\nThe directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the GCL, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-Laws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted. \n\n \n\nSubject to the terms of anyone or more classes or series of Preferred Stock, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death or incapacity, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and directors so elected shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders at which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier death or incapacity, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. \n\n\n\nSubject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any or all of the directors of the Corporation may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the Corporation\u2019s then outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. \n\n \n\nSIXTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for breach of the director\u2019s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the GCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any alteration, amendment or repeal of this Article SIXTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such alteration, amendment or repeal with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such alteration, amendment or repeal. \n\n \n\nSEVENTH: The Corporation is to have perpetual existence. \n\n \n\nEIGHTH: The By-Laws of the Corporation may be altered, amended or repealed in whole or in part, or new By-Laws may be adopted, by the stockholders or by the affirmative vote of the directors of the Corporation. As used in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the term \u201centire Board of Directors\u201d means the total number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies. \n\n \n\nNINTH: Special meetings of stockholders may be called by any of (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) the President, (iii) any Vice President, (iv) the Secretary, or (v) any Assistant Secretary, and shall be called by any such officer at the request in writing of a majority of the entire Board of Directors or at the request in writing of stockholders owning a majority of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. \n\n \n\nTENTH: The Corporation elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the GCL. \n\n \n\nELEVENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights conferred upon stockholders hereby are granted subject to this reservation. \n\n \n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be executed on its behalf this 7th day of February, 1996. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDT CORPORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy:\n\n \n\n/s/    HOWARD S.
