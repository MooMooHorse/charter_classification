Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification\n\nprovided in this Section 1(a) if, by reason of his Corporate Status (as\n\nhereinafter defined), he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or\n\nparticipant in any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined) other than a Proceeding\n\nby or in the right of the corporation. Pursuant to this Section 1(a), Indemnitee\n\nshall be indemnified against all Expenses (as hereinafter defined), judgments,\n\npenalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred\n\nby him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue\n\nor matter therein, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably\n\nbelieved to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and,\n\nwith respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his\n\nconduct was unlawful.\n\n\n\n                  (b) Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation.\n\nIndemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this\n\nSection 1(b) if, by reason of his Corporate Status, he is, or is threatened to\n\nbe made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding brought by or in the right\n\nof the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor.

If\n\nIndemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful on the\n\nmerits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or\n\nmatters in such Proceeding, the corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against\n\nall Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in\n\nconnection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. For purposes\n\nof this Section 1 and without limitation, the termination of any claim issue or\n\nmatter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be\n\ndeemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. \n\n\n\n         Section 2. In addition to, and without regard to any limitations on,\n\nthe indemnification provided for in Section 1, the corporation shall indemnify\n\nand hold harmless Indemnitee against all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines\n\nand amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his\n\nbehalf if, by reason of his Corporate Status he is, or is threatened to be made,\n\na party to or participant in any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the\n\nright of the corporation), including, without limitation, all liability arising\n\nout of the negligence or active or passive wrongdoing of Indemnitee. The only\n\nlimitation that shall exist upon the corporation's obligations pursuant to these\n\nBylaws or any indemnification agreement between the corporation and Indemnitee\n\nshall be that the corporation shall not be obligated to make any payment to\n\nIndemnitee that is finally determined (under the procedures, and subject to the\n\npresumptions, set forth in Sections 6 and 7 hereof) to be unlawful under\n\nDelaware law.\n\n\n\n         Section 3.\n\n\n\n                  (a) Whether or not the indemnification provided in Sections 1\n\nand 2 hereof is available, in respect of any threatened, pending or completed\n\naction, suit or proceeding in which corporation is jointly liable with\n\nIndemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding),\n\ncorporation shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount of any judgment\n\nor settlement of such action, suit or proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to\n\ncontribute to such payment and corporation hereby waives and relinquishes any\n\nright of contribution it may have against Indemnitee. The corporation shall not\n\nenter into any settlement of any action, suit or proceeding in which corporation\n\nis jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or\n\nproceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all\n\nclaims asserted against Indemnitee.\n\n\n\n                  (b) Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the\n\ncorporation set forth in the preceding subparagraph, if, for any reason,\n\nIndemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment\n\nor settlement in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding\n\nin which corporation is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in\n\nsuch action, suit or proceeding), corporation shall contribute to the amount of\n\nexpenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in\n\nsettlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in\n\nproportion to the relative benefits received by the corporation and all\n\nofficers, directors or employees of the corporation other than \n\n\n\n<PAGE>   6\n\n\n\nIndemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such\n\naction, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand,\n\nfrom the transaction from which such action, suit or proceeding arose; provided,\n\nhowever, that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit may, to\n\nthe extent necessary to conform to law, be further adjusted by reference to the\n\nrelative fault of corporation and all officers, directors or employees of the\n\ncorporation other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or\n\nwould be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and\n\nIndemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the events that resulted in\n\nsuch expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other\n\nequitable considerations which the law may require to be considered. The\n\nrelative fault of corporation and all officers, directors or employees of the\n\ncorporation other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or\n\nwould be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and\n\nIndemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other\n\nthings, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain\n\npersonal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or\n\nsecondary, and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive.\n\n\n\n                  (c) The corporation shall fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee\n\nharmless from any claims of contribution which may be brought by officers,\n\ndirectors or employees of the corporation other than Indemnitee who may be\n\njointly liable with Indemnitee. \n\n\n\n         Section 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XI, to\n\nthe extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a witness in\n\nany Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he shall be indemnified\n\nagainst all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in\n\nconnection therewith.\n\n\n\n         Section 5. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the corporation\n\nshall advance all reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in\n\nconnection with any Proceeding by reason of Indemnity's Corporate Status within\n\nten days after the receipt by the corporation of a statement or statements from\n\nIndemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior\n\nto or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements\n\nshall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include\n\nor be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to\n\nrepay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee\n\nis not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. Any advances and\n\nundertakings to repay pursuant to this Section 5 shall be unsecured and interest\n\nfree. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the corporation to\n\nadvance Expenses pursuant to this Section 5 shall be subject to the condition\n\nthat, if, when and to the extent that the corporation determines that Indemnitee\n\nwould not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, the corporation\n\nshall be entitled to be reimbursed, within thirty (30) days of such\n\ndetermination, by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the corporation)\n\nfor all such amounts theretofore paid; provided, however, that if Indemnitee has\n\ncommenced or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of competent\n\njurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified\n\nunder applicable law, any determination made by the corporation that Indemnitee\n\nwould not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be\n\nbinding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the corporation for\n\nany advance of Expenses until a final judicial determination is \n\n\n\n<PAGE>   7\n\n\n\nmade with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been\n\nexhausted or lapsed).\n\n\n\n         Section 6. It is the intent of the corporation to secure for Indemnitee\n\nrights of indemnity that are as favorable as may be permitted under the law and\n\npublic policy of the State of Delaware. Accordingly, the following procedures\n\nand presumptions shall apply in the event of any question as to whether\n\nIndemnitee is entitled to indemnification\n\n\n\n                  (a) To obtain indemnification (including, but not limited to,\n\nthe advancement of Expenses and contribution by the corporation), Indemnitee\n\nshall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or\n\ntherewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to\n\nIndemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent\n\nIndemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the corporation\n\nshall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the\n\nBoard of Directors in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.\n\n\n\n                  (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification\n\npursuant to the first sentence hereof, a determination, if required by\n\napplicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made\n\nin the specific case by one of the following three methods, which shall be at\n\nthe election of Indemnitee: (1) by a majority vote of the disinterested\n\ndirectors, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by independent legal counsel\n\nin a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.\n\n\n\n                  (c) If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is\n\nto be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof, the\n\nIndependent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 6(c). The\n\nIndependent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall\n\nrequest that such selection be made by the Board of Directors). Indemnitee or\n\nthe corporation, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written\n\nnotice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the corporation or to\n\nIndemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided,\n\nhowever, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the\n\nIndependent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of \"Independent\n\nCounsel\" as defined in Section 12 hereof, and the objection shall set form with\n\nparticularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely\n\nobjection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If a written\n\nobjection is made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel selected may not\n\nserve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a\n\ncourt has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days\n\nafter submission by Indemnitee of a written retest for indemnification pursuant\n\nto Section 6(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not\n\nobjected to, either the corporation or Indemnitee may petition the Court of\n\nChancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for\n\nresolution of any objection which shall have been made by the corporation or\n\nIndemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the\n\nappointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such\n\nother person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom\n\nan objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as\n\nIndependent Counsel under Section 6(b) hereof. The corporation shall pay any and\n\nan reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such\n\nIndependent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof,\n\nand the corporation shall pay an reasonable fees and expenses incident to \n\n\n\n<PAGE>   8\n\n\n\nthe procedures of this Section 6(c), regardless of the manner in which such\n\nIndependent Counsel was selected or appointed.\n\n\n\n                  (d) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to\n\nindemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such\n\ndetermination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if\n\nIndemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with\n\nSection 6(a) hereof. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the\n\nburden of proof and the burden of persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n\n\n                  (e) Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if\n\nIndemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the\n\nEnterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to\n\nIndemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or\n\non the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records\n\ngiven or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public\n\naccountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by\n\nthe Enterprise. In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of\n\nany director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed\n\nto Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under\n\nthis Article XI. Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(e)\n\nare satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that Indemnitee has at all\n\ntimes acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not\n\nopposed to the best interests of the corporation Anyone seeking to overcome this\n\npresumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence. \n\n\n\n                  (f) The corporation acknowledges that a settlement or other\n\ndisposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to\n\navoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty. In the event that\n\nany action, claim or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in\n\nany manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without\n\nlimitation, settlement of such action, claim or proceeding with or without\n\npayment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee\n\nhas been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or\n\nproceeding.
