A Request shall be delivered by\n\nregistered mail, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Company at\n\nthe Company\u2019s principal executive office. Such Request shall be deemed to have\n\nbeen made when actually received by the Company. A Request shall include: (i)\n\nthe name and address and telephone number of the Requesting Person; (ii) the\n\nnumber and percentage of Company Securities then Beneficially Owned by the\n\nRequesting Person and (iii) a reasonably detailed description of the Proposed\n\nTransaction or Proposed Transactions by which the Requesting Person would\n\npropose to effect a Five Percent Transaction and the proposed tax treatment\n\nthereof. The Board of Directors shall, in good faith, endeavor to respond to a\n\nRequest within twenty (20) Business Days of receiving such Request; provided\n\nthat the failure of the Board of Directors to make a determination within such\n\nperiod shall be deemed to constitute the denial by the Board of Directors of\n\nthe Request. The Requesting Person shall respond promptly to reasonable and\n\nappropriate requests for additional information from the Company or the Board\n\nof Directors and its advisors to assist the Board of Directors in making its\n\ndetermination. The Board of Directors shall only authorize a Proposed\n\nTransaction if it receives, at the Board\u2019s request, a report from the\n\nCompany\u2019s advisors to the effect that the Proposed Transaction does not create\n\na significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the\n\nBoard of Directors otherwise determines in its sole discretion that granting\n\nthe Request is in the best interests of the Company. Any Request may be\n\nsubmitted on a confidential basis and, except to the extent required by\n\napplicable law, the Company shall maintain the confidentiality of such Request\n\nand the determination of the Board of Directors with respect thereto, unless\n\nthe information contained in the Request or the determination of the Board of\n\nDirectors with respect thereto otherwise becomes publicly available. The\n\nRequest shall be considered and evaluated by directors serving on the Board of\n\nDirectors who are independent of the Company and the Requesting Person and\n\ndisinterested with respect to the Request, who shall constitute a committee of\n\nthe Board for this purpose, and the action of a majority of such independent\n\nand disinterested directors, or any committee of the Board consisting solely\n\nof these directors, shall be deemed to be the determination of the Board of\n\nDirectors for purposes of such Request. Furthermore, the Board of Directors\n\nshall approve within ten (10) Business Days of receiving a Request as provided\n\nin this Section 3(b) of (x) any proposed Transfer that does not cause any\n\naggregate increase in the Beneficial Ownership of Stock by Five Percent\n\nStockholders (as determined after giving effect to the proposed Transfer) over\n\nthe lowest Beneficial Ownership of Stock by such Five Percent Stockholders (as\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\ndetermined immediately before the proposed Transfer) at any time during the\n\nrelevant testing period, in all cases for purposes of Section 382 of the Code,\n\nor (y) any proposed Transfer by the United States Department of the Treasury\n\nif such proposed Transfer and all prior and anticipated Transfers or other\n\ntransactions effected or expected to be effected during the relevant testing\n\nperiod do not result in an aggregate \u201cowner shift\u201d (as defined in the Code) of\n\nmore than 40% for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. For purposes of clause\n\n(y) above, it shall be assumed that within such testing period all of the\n\nCommon Stock originally exchanged for the Series C Perpetual, Convertible,\n\nParticipating Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $5.00 per share, has\n\nbeen, or will be, sold. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of clauses\n\n(x) and (y) above, all Transfers shall be taken into account notwithstanding\n\nthat pursuant to Notice 2008-84 (and any regulations issued pursuant thereto)\n\nno testing date may have occurred with respect to such Transfer.\n\n\n\n(c) In addition to Section 3(b), the Board of Directors may determine that the\n\nrestrictions set forth in Section 2(a) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall not\n\napply to any particular transaction or transactions, whether or not a request\n\nhas been made to the Board of Directors, including a Request pursuant to\n\nSection 3(b) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, subject to any conditions that it deems\n\nreasonable and appropriate in connection therewith. Any determination of the\n\nBoard of Directors hereunder may be made prospectively or retroactively.\n\n\n\n(d) The Board of Directors, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may\n\nexercise the authority granted by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN through duly\n\nauthorized officers or agents of the Company.\n\n\n\n(4) Excess Securities.\n\n\n\n(a) No employee or agent of the Company shall record any Prohibited Transfer,\n\nand the purported Transferee of such a Prohibited Transfer (the \u201cPurported\n\nTransferee\u201d) shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the Company for any\n\npurpose whatsoever in respect of the Company Securities which are the subject\n\nof the Prohibited Transfer (the \u201cExcess Securities\u201d). Until the Excess\n\nSecurities are acquired by another Person in a Transfer that is not a\n\nProhibited Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall not be entitled to any\n\nrights thereunder, including rights of stockholders of the Company with\n\nrespect to such Excess Securities, including, without limitation, the right to\n\nvote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether\n\nliquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any, and the Excess\n\nSecurities shall be deemed to remain with the Transferor unless and until the\n\nExcess Securities are transferred to the Agent pursuant to Section 5 of this\n\nARTICLE THIRTEEN or until an approval is obtained under Section 3 of this\n\nARTICLE THIRTEEN. After the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer\n\nthat is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Company Securities shall cease to be\n\nExcess Securities. For this purpose, any Transfer of Excess Securities not in\n\naccordance with the provisions of this Section 4 or Section 5 of this ARTICLE\n\nTHIRTEEN shall also be a Prohibited Transfer.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(b) The Company may make such arrangements or issue such instructions to its\n\nstock transfer agent as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be\n\nnecessary or advisable to implement this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, including, without\n\nlimitation, authorizing, in accordance with Section 9 of this ARTICLE\n\nTHIRTEEN, such transfer agent to require an affidavit from a Purported\n\nTransferee regarding such Person\u2019s Beneficial Ownership of Stock and other\n\nevidence that a Transfer will not be prohibited by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN as a\n\ncondition to registering any Transfer.\n\n\n\n(5) Transfer to Agent. If the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer of\n\nCompany Securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer then, upon written demand\n\nby the Company sent within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Board of\n\nDirectors determines that the attempted Transfer constitutes a Prohibited\n\nTransfer, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or cause to be transferred\n\nany certificate or other evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within\n\nthe Purported Transferee\u2019s possession or control, together with any Prohibited\n\nDistributions, or, in the case of uncertificated Stock, shall automatically be\n\ndeemed to be transferred to an agent designated by the Board of Directors (the\n\n\u201cAgent\u201d). The Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers, which may\n\ninclude the Company, the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more\n\narm\u2019s-length transactions (on the public securities market on which such\n\nExcess Securities are traded, if possible, or otherwise privately); provided,\n\nhowever, that any such sale must not constitute a Prohibited Transfer; and\n\nprovided further that the Agent shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly\n\nfashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific\n\ntime frame if, in the Agent\u2019s discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the\n\nmarket for the Company Securities, would otherwise adversely affect the value\n\nof the Company Securities or would be in violation of applicable securities\n\nlaws. If the Purported Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before\n\nreceiving the Company\u2019s demand to surrender Excess Securities to the Agent,\n\nthe Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities\n\nfor the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited\n\nDistributions and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the Company\n\ngrants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of\n\nsuch sales proceeds and Prohibited Distributions not exceeding the amount that\n\nthe Purported Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to\n\nSection 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN if the Agent rather than the Purported\n\nTransferee had resold the Excess Securities for an amount equal to the\n\nproceeds of such sale by the Purported Transferee (and taking into account\n\nonly the actual costs incurred by the Agent).\n\n\n\n(6) Application of Proceeds and Prohibited Distributions. The Agent shall\n\napply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and, if the Purported\n\nTransferee has previously resold the Excess Securities, any amounts received\n\nby the Agent from a Purported Transferee, together, in either case, with any\n\nProhibited Distributions, as follows: (a) first, such amounts shall be paid to\n\nthe Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in\n\nconnection with its duties hereunder; (b) second,\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nany remaining amounts shall be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the\n\namount paid by the Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or the\n\nMarket Price at the time of the Transfer, in the event the purported Transfer\n\nof the Excess Securities was, in whole or in part, a gift, inheritance or\n\nsimilar Transfer); and (c) third, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the\n\nTransferor that was party to the subject Prohibited Transfer, or, if the\n\nTransferor that was party to the subject Prohibited Transfer cannot be readily\n\nidentified, to one or more organizations qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of\n\nthe Code (or any comparable successor provision) selected by the Board of\n\nDirectors. The Purported Transferee of Excess Securities shall have no claim,\n\ncause of action or any other recourse whatsoever against any Transferor of\n\nExcess Securities. The Purported Transferee\u2019s sole right with respect to such\n\nshares shall be limited to the amount payable to the Purported Transferee\n\npursuant to this Section 6. In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of\n\nExcess Securities pursuant to this Section 6 inure to the benefit of the\n\nCompany or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover costs and expenses\n\nincurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder.\n\n\n\n(7) Modification of Remedies for Certain Indirect Transfers. In the event of\n\nany Transfer that does not involve a transfer of securities of the Company\n\nwithin the meaning of Delaware law (\u201cSecurities,\u201d and individually, a\n\n\u201cSecurity\u201d) but which would cause the transferee or any other Person to become\n\na Five Percent Stockholder, or would cause the Beneficial Ownership of a Five\n\nPercent Stockholder to increase, the application of Section 5 and Section 6 of\n\nthis ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall be modified as described in this Section 7. In\n\nsuch case, no such Five Percent Stockholder shall be required to dispose of\n\nany interest that is not a Security, but such Five Percent Stockholder and/or\n\nany Person whose ownership of Securities is attributed to such Five Percent\n\nStockholder shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to\n\ndispose of sufficient Securities (which Securities shall be disposed of in the\n\ninverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such Five Percent\n\nStockholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of this\n\nARTICLE THIRTEEN. Such disposition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously\n\nwith the Transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such\n\nnumber of Securities that are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered\n\nExcess Securities and shall be disposed of through the Agent as provided in\n\nSections 5 and 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, except that the maximum aggregate\n\namount payable either to such Five Percent Stockholder, or to such other\n\nPerson that was the direct holder of such Excess Securities, in connection\n\nwith such sale shall be the Market Price of such Excess Securities at the time\n\nof the purported Transfer. All expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing of\n\nsuch Excess Securities shall be paid out of any amounts due such Five Percent\n\nStockholder or such other Person. The purpose of this Section 7 is to extend\n\nthe restrictions in Sections 2 and 4 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN to situations in\n\nwhich there is a Five Percent Transaction without a direct Transfer of\n\nSecurities, and this Section 7, along with the other provisions of this\n\nARTICLE THIRTEEN, shall be interpreted to produce the same results, with\n\ndifferences as the context requires, as a direct Transfer of Company\n\nSecurities.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(8) Legal Proceedings; Prompt Enforcement. If the Purported Transferee fails\n\nto surrender the Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof, in\n\neither case, with any Prohibited Distributions, to the Agent within thirty\n\n(30) days from the date on which the Company makes a written demand pursuant\n\nto Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN (whether or not made within the time\n\nspecified in Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN), then the Company may take\n\nany actions it deems necessary to enforce the provisions hereof, including the\n\ninstitution of legal proceedings to compel the surrender. Nothing in this\n\nSection 8 shall (a) be deemed inconsistent with any Transfer of the Excess\n\nSecurities provided in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN being void ab initio, (b)\n\npreclude the Company in its discretion from immediately bringing legal\n\nproceedings without a prior demand or (c) cause any failure of the Company to\n\nact within the time periods set forth in Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN to\n\nconstitute a waiver or loss of any right of the Company under this ARTICLE\n\nTHIRTEEN.
