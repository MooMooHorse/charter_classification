The prior sentence shall not preclude either the Transfer to the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), Clearing and Depository Services (\u201cCDS\u201d) or to any other securities intermediary, as such term is defined in \u00a7 8-102(a)(14) of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code, of Company Securities not previously held through DTC, CDS or such intermediary or the settlement of any transactions in the Company Securities entered into through the facilities of a national securities exchange, any national securities quotation system or any electronic or other alternative trading system; provided that, if such Transfer or the settlement of the transaction would result in a Prohibited Transfer, such Transfer shall nonetheless be a Prohibited Transfer subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in the remainder of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN.\n\n \n\n13\n\n\n\n(3) Exceptions; Waiver of Transfer and Ownership Restrictions.\n\n(a) Any Transfer of Company Securities that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to Section 2(a) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall nonetheless be permitted if (i) prior to such Transfer being consummated (or, in the case of an involuntary Transfer, as soon as practicable after the transaction is consummated), the Board of Directors approves the Transfer in accordance with Section 3(b) or 3(c) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN (such approval may relate to a Transfer or series of identified Transfers and may provide the effective time of such transfer which could be retroactive), (ii) such Transfer is pursuant to any transaction, including, but not limited to, a merger, consolidation, mandatory share exchange or other business combination in which all holders of Company Securities receive, or are offered the same opportunity to receive, cash or other consideration for all such Company Securities, and upon the consummation of which the acquiror owns at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (iii) such Transfer is a Transfer to any employee stock ownership or other employee benefit plan of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (or any entity or trustee holding shares of Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or for the purpose of funding any such plan or funding other employee benefits for employees of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company) or (iv) such Transfer is a Transfer to any underwriter, dealer or initial purchaser from the United States Department of the Treasury for resale in a transaction contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement, dated January 14, 2011, as amended from time to time, between the Company and the United States Department of the Treasury; provided, however, that Transfers by such underwriter, dealer or purchaser in such offering remain subject to this ARTICLE THIRTEEN.\n\n(b) The restrictions contained in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN are for the purposes of reducing the risk that any \u201cownership change\u201d (as defined in the Code) with respect to the Company may limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its Tax Benefits. The restrictions set forth in Section 2(a) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall not apply to a proposed Transfer that is a Five Percent Transaction if the Transferor or the Transferee obtains the authorization of the Board of Directors in the manner described below. In connection therewith, and to provide for effective policing of these provisions, any Person who desires to effect a transaction that may be a Five Percent Transaction (a \u201cRequesting Person\u201d) shall, prior to the date of such transaction for which the Requesting Person seeks authorization (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d), request in writing (a \u201cRequest\u201d) that the Board of Directors review the Proposed Transaction and authorize or not authorize the Proposed Transaction in accordance with this Section 3(b). A Request shall be delivered by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of\n\n \n\n14\n\n\n\nthe Company at the Company\u2019s principal executive office. Such Request shall be deemed to have been made when actually received by the Company. A Request shall include: (i) the name and address and telephone number of the Requesting Person; (ii) the number and percentage of Company Securities then Beneficially Owned by the Requesting Person and (iii) a reasonably detailed description of the Proposed Transaction or Proposed Transactions by which the Requesting Person would propose to effect a Five Percent Transaction and the proposed tax treatment thereof. The Board of Directors shall, in good faith, endeavor to respond to a Request within twenty (20) Business Days of receiving such Request; provided that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a determination within such period shall be deemed to constitute the denial by the Board of Directors of the Request. The Requesting Person shall respond promptly to reasonable and appropriate requests for additional information from the Company or the Board of Directors and its advisors to assist the Board of Directors in making its determination. The Board of Directors shall only authorize a Proposed Transaction if it receives, at the Board\u2019s request, a report from the Company\u2019s advisors to the effect that the Proposed Transaction does not create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Board of Directors otherwise determines in its sole discretion that granting the Request is in the best interests of the Company. Any Request may be submitted on a confidential basis and, except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company shall maintain the confidentiality of such Request and the determination of the Board of Directors with respect thereto, unless the information contained in the Request or the determination of the Board of Directors with respect thereto otherwise becomes publicly available. The Request shall be considered and evaluated by directors serving on the Board of Directors who are independent of the Company and the Requesting Person and disinterested with respect to the Request, who shall constitute a committee of the Board for this purpose, and the action of a majority of such independent and disinterested directors, or any committee of the Board consisting solely of these directors, shall be deemed to be the determination of the Board of Directors for purposes of such Request. Furthermore, the Board of Directors shall approve within ten (10) Business Days of receiving a Request as provided in this Section 3(b) of (x) any proposed Transfer that does not cause any aggregate increase in the Beneficial Ownership of Stock by Five Percent Stockholders (as determined after giving effect to the proposed Transfer) over the lowest Beneficial Ownership of Stock by such Five Percent Stockholders (as determined immediately before the proposed Transfer) at any time during the relevant testing period, in all cases for purposes of Section 382 of the Code, or (y) any proposed Transfer by the United States Department of the Treasury if such proposed Transfer and all prior and anticipated Transfers or other transactions effected or expected to be effected during the relevant testing period do not result in an aggregate \u201cowner shift\u201d (as\n\n \n\n15\n\n\n\ndefined in the Code) of more than 40% for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. For purposes of clause (y) above, it shall be assumed that within such testing period all of the Common Stock originally exchanged for the Series C Perpetual, Convertible, Participating Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $5.00 per share, has been, or will be, sold. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of clauses (x) and (y) above, all Transfers shall be taken into account notwithstanding that pursuant to Notice 2008-84 (and any regulations issued pursuant thereto) no testing date may have occurred with respect to such Transfer.\n\n(c) In addition to Section 3(b), the Board of Directors may determine that the restrictions set forth in Section 2(a) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall not apply to any particular transaction or transactions, whether or not a request has been made to the Board of Directors, including a Request pursuant to Section 3(b) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, subject to any conditions that it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection therewith. Any determination of the Board of Directors hereunder may be made prospectively or retroactively.\n\n(d) The Board of Directors, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may exercise the authority granted by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN through duly authorized officers or agents of the Company.\n\n(4) Excess Securities.\n\n(a) No employee or agent of the Company shall record any Prohibited Transfer, and the purported Transferee of such a Prohibited Transfer (the \u201cPurported Transferee\u201d) shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the Company for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Company Securities which are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the \u201cExcess Securities\u201d). Until the Excess Securities are acquired by another Person in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall not be entitled to any rights thereunder, including rights of stockholders of the Company with respect to such Excess Securities, including, without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any, and the Excess Securities shall be deemed to remain with the Transferor unless and until the Excess Securities are transferred to the Agent pursuant to Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN or until an approval is obtained under Section 3 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. After the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Company Securities shall cease to be Excess Securities. For this purpose, any Transfer of Excess Securities not in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4 or Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall also be a Prohibited Transfer.\n\n \n\n16\n\n\n\n(b) The Company may make such arrangements or issue such instructions to its stock transfer agent as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be necessary or advisable to implement this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, including, without limitation, authorizing, in accordance with Section 9 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, such transfer agent to require an affidavit from a Purported Transferee regarding such Person\u2019s Beneficial Ownership of Stock and other evidence that a Transfer will not be prohibited by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN as a condition to registering any Transfer.\n\n(5) Transfer to Agent. If the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer of Company Securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer then, upon written demand by the Company sent within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Board of Directors determines that the attempted Transfer constitutes a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported Transferee\u2019s possession or control, together with any Prohibited Distributions, or, in the case of uncertificated Stock, shall automatically be deemed to be transferred to an agent designated by the Board of Directors (the \u201cAgent\u201d). The Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers, which may include the Company, the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more arm\u2019s-length transactions (on the public securities market on which such Excess Securities are traded, if possible, or otherwise privately); provided, however, that any such sale must not constitute a Prohibited Transfer; and provided further that the Agent shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if, in the Agent\u2019s discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the market for the Company Securities, would otherwise adversely affect the value of the Company Securities or would be in violation of applicable securities laws. If the Purported Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the Company\u2019s demand to surrender Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the Company grants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds and Prohibited Distributions not exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to Section 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN if the Agent rather than the Purported Transferee had resold the Excess Securities for an amount equal to the proceeds of such sale by the Purported Transferee (and taking into account only the actual costs incurred by the Agent).\n\n(6) Application of Proceeds and Prohibited Distributions. The Agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and, if the Purported Transferee has previously resold the Excess Securities, any amounts received by the Agent from a Purported Transferee, together, in either case, with any Prohibited Distributions, as follows: (a) first, such amounts shall be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in\n\n \n\n17\n\n\n\nconnection with its duties hereunder; (b) second, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by the Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or the Market Price at the time of the Transfer, in the event the purported Transfer of the Excess Securities was, in whole or in part, a gift, inheritance or similar Transfer); and (c) third, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Transferor that was party to the subject Prohibited Transfer, or, if the Transferor that was party to the subject Prohibited Transfer cannot be readily identified, to one or more organizations qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of the Code (or any comparable successor provision) selected by the Board of Directors. The Purported Transferee of Excess Securities shall have no claim, cause of action or any other recourse whatsoever against any Transferor of Excess Securities. The Purported Transferee\u2019s sole right with respect to such shares shall be limited to the amount payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to this Section 6. In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to this Section 6 inure to the benefit of the Company or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder.\n\n(7) Modification of Remedies for Certain Indirect Transfers. In the event of any Transfer that does not involve a transfer of securities of the Company within the meaning of Delaware law (\u201cSecurities,\u201d and individually, a \u201cSecurity\u201d) but which would cause the transferee or any other Person to become a Five Percent Stockholder, or would cause the Beneficial Ownership of a Five Percent Stockholder to increase, the application of Section 5 and Section 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall be modified as described in this Section 7. In such case, no such Five Percent Stockholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is not a Security, but such Five Percent Stockholder and/or any Person whose ownership of Securities is attributed to such Five Percent Stockholder shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to dispose of sufficient Securities (which Securities shall be disposed of in the inverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such Five Percent Stockholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. Such disposition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such number of Securities that are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered Excess Securities and shall be disposed of through the Agent as provided in Sections 5 and 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, except that the maximum aggregate amount payable either to such Five Percent Stockholder, or to such other Person that was the direct holder of such Excess Securities, in connection with such sale shall be the Market Price of such Excess Securities at the time of the purported Transfer. All expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing of such Excess Securities shall be paid out of any amounts due such Five Percent Stockholder or such other Person. The purpose of this Section 7 is to extend the restrictions in Sections 2 and 4 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN to situations in which there is a Five Percent Transaction without a direct Transfer of Securities, and this Section 7, along with the other provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, shall be interpreted to produce the\n\n \n\n18\n\n\n\nsame results, with differences as the context requires, as a direct Transfer of Company Securities.\n\n(8) Legal Proceedings; Prompt Enforcement. If the Purported Transferee fails to surrender the Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof, in either case, with any Prohibited Distributions, to the Agent within thirty (30) days from the date on which the Company makes a written demand pursuant to Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN (whether or not made within the time specified in Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN), then the Company may take any actions it deems necessary to enforce the provisions hereof, including the institution of legal proceedings to compel the surrender. Nothing in this Section 8 shall (a) be deemed inconsistent with any Transfer of the Excess Securities provided in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN being void ab initio, (b) preclude the Company in its discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings without a prior demand or (c) cause any failure of the Company to act within the time periods set forth in Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN to constitute a waiver or loss of any right of the Company under this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. The Board of Directors may authorize such additional actions as it deems advisable to give effect to the provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN.\n\n(9) Obligation to Provide Information. As a condition to the registration of the Transfer of any Stock, any Person who is a beneficial, legal or record holder of Stock, and any proposed Transferee and any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the proposed Transferee, shall provide such information, to the extent reasonably available and legally permissible, as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to determine compliance with this ARTICLE THIRTEEN or the status of the Tax Benefits of the Company.\n\n(10) Legends. The Board of Directors may require that the registration of the Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company, or any certificates issued by the Company evidencing ownership of shares of Stock that are subject to the restrictions on transfer and ownership contained in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN bear the following legend:\n\n\u201cTHE TRANSFER OF SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE THIRTEEN OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC., AS AMENDED AND IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE COMPANY UPON REQUEST.\u201d\n\nThe Board of Directors may also require that any certificates or other evidence of ownership issued by the Company evidencing ownership of shares of Stock that are subject to conditions imposed by the Board of Directors under Section 3 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN also bear a conspicuous legend referencing the applicable restrictions.\n\n \n\n19\n\n\n\nThe Company shall have the power to make appropriate notations upon its stock transfer records or other evidence of ownership and to instruct any transfer agent, registrar, securities intermediary or depository with respect to the requirements of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN for any uncertificated Company Securities or Company Securities held in an indirect holding system.\n\n(11) Authority of Board of Directors.\n\n(a) All determinations and interpretations of the Board of Directors shall be interpreted or determined, as the case may be, by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN.\n\n(b) The Board of Directors shall have the power to determine all matters necessary for assessing compliance with this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, including, without limitation, (i) the identification of Five Percent Stockholders, (ii) whether a Transfer is a Five Percent Transaction or a Prohibited Transfer, (iii) the Beneficial Ownership in the Company of any Five Percent Stockholder, (iv) whether an instrument constitutes a Company Security, (v) the amount (or Market Price) due to a Purported Transferee pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, and (vi) any other matters which the Board of Directors determines to be relevant; and the good faith determination of the Board of Directors on such matters shall be conclusive and binding for all the purposes of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. In addition, the Board of Directors may, to the extent permitted by law, from time to time establish, modify, amend or rescind by-laws, regulations and procedures of the Company not inconsistent with the provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN for purposes of determining whether any Transfer of Company Securities would jeopardize the Company\u2019s ability to preserve and use the Tax Benefits and for the orderly application, administration and implementation of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN.\n\n(c) Nothing contained in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors to take such other action to the extent permitted by law as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Company and its stockholders in preserving the Tax Benefits. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a change in law making one or more of the following actions necessary or desirable, the Board of Directors may, by adopting a written resolution, (i) modify the definition of Beneficial Ownership in the Company, Five Percent Stockholder or the Persons covered by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, (ii) modify the definitions of any other terms set forth in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN or (iii) modify the terms of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN as appropriate, in each case, in order to prevent an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code (or other sections of the Code or any similar state law, if applicable) as a result of any changes in applicable law or otherwise; provided, however, that the\n\n \n\n20\n\n\n\nBoard of Directors shall not cause there to be such modification unless it receives a report, at the Board\u2019s request, from the Company\u2019s advisors to the effect that such action is reasonably necessary or advisable to preserve the Tax Benefits or that the continuation of certain restrictions is no longer reasonably necessary for the preservation of the Tax Benefits. The Board shall cause the prompt public announcement of such modification in such manner as the Board determines appropriate under the circumstances. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, including any definition used herein, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions with respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or knowledge of the circumstances. In the event this ARTICLE THIRTEEN requires an action by the Board of Directors but fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. All such actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations that are done or made by the Board of Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the Company, the Agent, and all other Persons for all other purposes of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. The Board of Directors may delegate all or any portion of its duties and powers under this ARTICLE THIRTEEN to a committee of the Board of Directors as it deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may exercise the authority granted by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN through duly authorized officers or agents of the Company.\n\n(12) Reliance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company and the members of the Board of Directors shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the information, opinions, reports or statements of the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, the chief accounting officer or the corporate controller or other executive officers of the Company or of the Company\u2019s legal counsel, independent auditors, transfer agent, investment bankers or other employees and agents in making the determinations and findings contemplated by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, and the members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any good faith errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence and identity of, and the amount of any Company Securities Beneficially Owned by any stockholder, the Company is entitled to rely on the existence and absence of filings of Schedule 13D or 13G under the Exchange Act (or similar filings), as of any date, subject to its actual knowledge of the ownership of Company Securities.\n\n(13) Benefits of This ARTICLE THIRTEEN. Nothing in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall be construed to give to any Person other than the Company or the Agent any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. This ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Company and the Agent.\n\n \n\n21\n\n\n\n(14) Severability. The purpose of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN is to facilitate the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or preserve its Tax Benefits. If any provision of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN or the application of any such provision to any Person or under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN.\n\n(15) Waiver. With regard to any power, remedy or right provided herein or otherwise available to the Company or the Agent under this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, (a) no waiver will be effective unless expressly contained in a writing signed by the waiving party, and (b) no alteration, modification or impairment will be implied by reason of any previous waiver, extension of time, delay or omission in exercise, or other indulgence.\n\n(16) Limitation of Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law, no director of the Company shall be liable for any breach of any duty under this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, it being understood that no director shall be responsible to the Corporation, any stockholder or any other Person for any action taken or omitted to be taken under this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. In particular, without creating any liability to any Person, the Board may distinguish between stockholders in connection with any Request under this ARTICLE THIRTEEN.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, said AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. has caused its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed and this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by Thomas A.
