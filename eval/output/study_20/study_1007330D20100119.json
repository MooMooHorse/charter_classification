The name of the corporation is PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n\n\n\n     2.   The  Articles  of  Amendment  to  the  Articles  of  Incorporation  of\n\n          PRG-SCHULTZ  INTERNATIONAL,  INC.,  attached hereto as Exhibit A, were\n\n          filed by the  Secretary  of State of the State of  Georgia on the 15th\n\n          day of March, 2006, and such document requires correction.\n\n\n\n     3.   The  incorrect  statements  in said  document and the reasons they are\n\n          incorrect are as follows:\n\n\n\n               a. the clause \"provided, that the aggregate number of votes shall\n\n          be rounded  down to the number of the  nearest  whole  share of common\n\n          stock after taking into account all shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\n          held by any holder  casting  such votes\"  contained  in Section 4.5 of\n\n          said Articles of Amendment was inserted through scrivener error; and\n\n\n\n               b. the clause \"provided, that the aggregate number of votes shall\n\n          be rounded  down to the number of the  nearest  whole  share of common\n\n          stock after taking into account all shares of Series B Preferred Stock\n\n          held by any holder  casting  such votes\"  contained  in Section 5.5 of\n\n          said Articles of Amendment was inserted through scrivener error.\n\n\n\n     4.   Sections 4.5 and 5.5 are  corrected by striking  such  clauses,  after\n\n          which they read in their entirety as follows:\n\n\n\n               \"Section  4.5.  Voting  Rights.  Each share of Series A Preferred\n\n          Stock will have the  number of votes  that the shares of common  stock\n\n          issuable upon  conversion of a share of Series A Preferred Stock would\n\n          have (referred to herein as voting on an \"as converted\"  basis).
