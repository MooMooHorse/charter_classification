The shares of such series shall be\n\ndesignated as \"Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock\" (the \"Series A\n\nPreferred Stock\") and the number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred\n\nStock shall be Five Hundred Thousand (500,000). Such number of shares may be\n\nincreased or decreased by resolution of the Board prior to issuance; PROVIDED,\n\nthat no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nto a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of\n\nshares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or\n\nwarrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the\n\nCorporation convertible into Series A Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n         Section 2.

In the event the\n\nCorporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock\n\npayable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision, combination or\n\nconsolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or\n\notherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a\n\ngreater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the\n\namount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled\n\nimmediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall\n\nbe adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is\n\nthe number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event\n\nand the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such event. In the event the Corporation shall\n\nat any time declare or pay any dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock payable\n\nin shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or effect a subdivision, combination or\n\nconsolidation of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (by\n\nreclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Series\n\nA Preferred Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under\n\nclause (b) of the first sentence of this Section 2(A) shall be adjusted by\n\nmultiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of\n\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to\n\nsuch event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock outstanding immediately after such event.\n\n\n\n         (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section\n\nimmediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock\n\n(other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock) and the Corporation\n\nshall pay such dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock before\n\nthe dividend or distribution declared on the Common Stock is paid or set apart;\n\nprovided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared\n\non the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment\n\nDate and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $10\n\nper share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such\n\nsubsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.\n\n\n\n         (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding\n\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next\n\npreceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such\n\nshares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment\n\nDate, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date\n\nof issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders\n\nof shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend\n\nand before such Quarterly Dividend\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nPayment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and\n\nbe cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid\n\ndividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the\n\ntime accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a\n\nshare-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board\n\nmay fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution\n\ndeclared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the\n\ndate fixed for the payment thereof.\n\n\n\n         Section 3.

In the event the Corporation shall\n\nat any time declare or pay any dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock payable\n\nin shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or effect a subdivision, combination or\n\nconsolidation of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (by\n\nreclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Series\n\nA Preferred Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which\n\nholders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to\n\nsuch event shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the\n\nnumerator of which is the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that were\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which is the\n\nnumber of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately after such\n\nevent.\n\n\n\n         (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Certificate of\n\nIncorporation or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and\n\nthe holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the\n\nCorporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all\n\nmatters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n         (C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Preferred Stock shall\n\nbe in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the holders\n\nof the Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate series from all other\n\nseries of Preferred Stock and classes of capital stock, shall be entitled to\n\nelect two members of the Board in addition to any Directors elected by any other\n\nseries, class or classes of securities and the authorized number of Directors\n\nwill automatically be increased by two.

Such special meeting shall in any event be held within 45 days\n\n         of the occurrence of such vacancy.\n\n\n\n                  (v) At such time as the arrearage is fully cured, and all\n\n         dividends accumulated and unpaid on any shares of Series A Preferred\n\n         Stock outstanding are paid, and, in addition thereto, at least one\n\n         regular dividend has been paid subsequent to curing such arrearage, the\n\n         term of office of any Director elected pursuant to this Section 3(C),\n\n         or his successor, shall automatically terminate, and the authorized\n\n         number of Directors shall automatically decrease by two, the rights of\n\n         the holders of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to vote as\n\n         provided in this Section 3(C) shall cease, subject to renewal from time\n\n         to time upon the same terms and conditions, and the holders of shares\n\n         of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have only the limited voting\n\n         rights elsewhere herein set forth.\n\n\n\n         (D) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law,\n\nholders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and\n\ntheir consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to\n\nvote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate\n\naction.\n\n\n\n         Section 4.

In the event the Corporation\n\nshall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nCommon Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision,\n\ncombination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by\n\nreclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common\n\nStock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each\n\nsuch case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the\n\nexchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by\n\nmultiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the\n\ndenominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such event. In the event the Corporation shall\n\nat any time declare or pay any dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock payable\n\nin shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or effect a subdivision, combination or\n\nconsolidation of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (by\n\nreclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Series\n\nA Preferred Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the first\n\nsentence of this Section 7 with respect to the exchange or change of shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a\n\nfraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event and the denominator\n\nof which is the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding\n\nimmediately after such event.\n\n\n\n         Section 8.
