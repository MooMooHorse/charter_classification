Declared dividends will be payable in cash. Any undeclared\n\ndividends will increase the liquidation preference as of the applicable\n\ndividend payment date.\n\n\n\n(b) Dividend Participation. If any dividends or distributions are paid on the\n\nCorporation\u2019s common stock (other than a dividend or distribution paid solely\n\nin additional shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock), the holders of Series\n\nA Preferred Stock will be paid dividends or distributions per share of Series\n\nA Preferred Stock in an amount equal to what such holder would have received\n\nhad it converted its shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common\n\nstock of the Corporation immediately prior to the record date for the payment\n\nof such dividend or distribution.\n\n\n\n(c) Partial Dividend Periods.

No dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock will be\n\nauthorized or declared or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation if\n\nsuch authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would\n\nviolate any of its agreements or is restricted or prohibited by law.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will\n\naccrue whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are\n\nfunds legally available for the payment of dividends and whether or not such\n\ndividends are authorized or declared by the Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n(e) Dividends not Declared and Paid in Full.

Upon any voluntary or involuntary\n\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the\n\nCorporation available for distribution to stockholders (after payment or\n\nprovision for all of the Corporation\u2019s debts and other liabilities and\n\npreference payments to holders of equity securities ranking senior to the\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock but before any payment or provision for any Junior\n\nStock) an amount equal to the greater of:\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(i) the amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the then-\n\neffective liquidation preference, plus any accrued and undeclared dividends to\n\nthe date of payment; and\n\n\n\n(ii) the amount per share the holder would have received in connection with\n\nsuch voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the\n\nCorporation had such holder converted such share of Series A Preferred Stock\n\ninto shares of common stock immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n(b) Distribution with Insufficient Assets. If, upon any voluntary or\n\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, its\n\nassets are insufficient to make full payment of the liquidating distributions\n\nto holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and any other shares the\n\nCorporation\u2019s equity securities ranking pari passu with the Series A Preferred\n\nStock as to liquidation rights (including the Series B Preferred Stock, if\n\nany), then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and pari passu shares\n\nwill share ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full\n\nliquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively\n\nentitled.\n\n\n\nSection 4.4. Conversion. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall\n\nhave conversion rights as follows:\n\n\n\n(a) Right to Convert. The Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible at the\n\nholder\u2019s option at any time. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be\n\ninitially convertible into 422.5 shares of common stock of the Corporation,\n\ncalculated by dividing the then-effective liquidation preference of each share\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock by the conversion price. The initial conversion\n\nprice is $0.28405, subject to anti-dilution adjustments described in this\n\nSection 4.4.\n\n\n\n(b) Notice of Conversion. In order to effect a conversion of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, a holder must deliver a notice of conversion to the\n\nCorporation. Upon receipt by the Corporation of the notice of conversion, the\n\nholder\u2019s shares of Series A Preferred Stock will immediately cease to have the\n\nrights and restrictions of preferred stock, and the holder will immediately be\n\ndeemed to have all the rights of a holder of shares of common stock. The\n\nCorporation will deliver a copy of the form of notice of conversion to each\n\nholder of Series A Preferred Stock prior to the convening of a stockholders\n\nmeeting to increase the Corporation\u2019s authorized capital or at any time at the\n\nrequest of a holder of Series A Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(c) Adjustments to Conversion Price. The conversion price will be subject to\n\nadjustment in the event the Corporation (i) pays a dividend or distribution\n\nsolely in shares of common stock; (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of\n\ncommon stock into a greater number of shares of common stock, or (iii)\n\ncombines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of\n\nshares of common stock. Concurrently with the effectiveness of any of the\n\nevents described in clauses (i) through (iii), the conversion price in effect\n\nimmediately prior thereto shall be adjusted by multiplying the conversion\n\nprice in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction of which\n\nthe numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding\n\nimmediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the number\n\nof shares of common stock outstanding immediately following such adjustment.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(d) Adjustments for Reclassification, Consolidation and Reorganization. In\n\ncase of any reclassification of the common stock, any consolidation of the\n\nCorporation with, or merger of the Corporation into, any other entity, any\n\nmerger of any entity into the Corporation (other than a merger that does not\n\nresult in reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of the\n\noutstanding shares of common stock), any sale or transfer of all or\n\nsubstantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any compulsory share\n\nexchange whereby the common stock is converted into other certain securities,\n\ncash or other property, then the holder of each share of Series A Preferred\n\nStock then outstanding shall have the right thereafter, during the period that\n\nthe Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, to convert that share only\n\ninto the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable\n\nupon the reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share\n\nexchange by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which one\n\nshare of Series A Preferred Stock would have been convertible immediately\n\nprior to the reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share\n\nexchange.\n\n\n\n(e) Further Adjustments. In the event that the Corporation\u2019s 2006 Management\n\nIncentive Plan as may be amended from time to time (\u201cMIP\u201d), provides for\n\nadjustments to the conversion or strike prices of the equity securities\n\ngranted thereunder or the number of shares issuable upon any such conversion\n\nthat would be in addition to or more favorable than the adjustments contained\n\nin clauses (c) and (d) of this Section 4.4, then the conversion price of the\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock or the number of shares issuable upon such conversion\n\nshall also be adjusted to the same extent as the conversion or strike prices\n\nof the equity securities granted under the MIP or the number of shares\n\nissuable upon any such conversion.

Upon receipt by the Corporation of the notice of conversion, the\n\nholder\u2019s shares of Series B Preferred Stock will immediately cease to have the\n\nrights and restrictions of preferred stock, and the holder will simultaneously\n\nreceive shares of common stock in accordance with the terms outlined above.\n\nThe Corporation will deliver a copy of the form of notice of conversion to\n\neach holder of Series B Preferred Stock at any time at the request of a holder\n\nof Series B Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(c) Adjustments to Conversion Price. The conversion price will be subject to\n\nadjustment in the event the Corporation (i) pays a dividend or distribution\n\nsolely in shares of common stock; (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of\n\ncommon stock into a greater number of shares of common stock, or (iii)\n\ncombines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of\n\nshares of common stock. Concurrently with the effectiveness of any of the\n\nevents described in clauses (i) through (iii), the conversion price in effect\n\nimmediately prior thereto shall be adjusted by multiplying the conversion\n\nprice in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction of which\n\nthe numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding\n\nimmediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the number\n\nof shares of common stock outstanding immediately following such adjustment.\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(d) Adjustments for Reclassification, Consolidation and Reorganization. In\n\ncase of any reclassification of the common stock, any consolidation of the\n\nCorporation with, or merger of the Corporation into, any other entity, any\n\nmerger of any entity into the Corporation (other than a merger that does not\n\nresult in reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of the\n\noutstanding shares of common stock), any sale or transfer of all or\n\nsubstantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any compulsory share\n\nexchange whereby the common stock is converted into other certain securities,\n\ncash or other property, then the holder of each share of Series B Preferred\n\nStock then outstanding shall have the right thereafter, during the period that\n\nthe Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, to convert that share only\n\ninto the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable\n\nupon the reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share\n\nexchange by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which one\n\nshare of Series B Preferred Stock would have been convertible immediately\n\nprior to the reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share\n\nexchange.\n\n\n\n(e) Further Adjustments. In the event that the MIP provides for adjustments to\n\nthe conversion or strike prices of the equity securities granted thereunder or\n\nthe number of shares issuable upon any such conversion that would be in\n\naddition to or more favorable than the adjustments contained in clauses (c)\n\nand (d) of this Section 5.4, then the conversion price of the Series B\n\nPreferred Stock or the number of shares issuable upon such conversion shall\n\nalso be adjusted to the same extent as the conversion or strike prices of the\n\nequity securities granted under the MIP or the number of shares issuable upon\n\nany such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment shall be\n\nmade to the conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock or the number of\n\nshares issuable upon such conversion due to any conversion of the Company\u2019s\n\n10% senior convertible notes due 2011, Series A Preferred Stock or Series B\n\nPreferred Stock, if any, or the exercise of any stock option.\n\n\n\n(f) Notices of Record Date. In the event that the Corporation shall propose at\n\nany time: (i) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its common stock,\n\nwhether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular\n\ncash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus; (ii) to\n\noffer for subscription pro rata to the holders of its common stock any\n\nadditional shares of stock of any class or series or other rights; (iii) to\n\neffect any reclassification or recapitalization of its common stock\n\noutstanding involving a change in the common stock; or (iv) to merge or\n\nconsolidate with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey all\n\nor substantially all of its assets, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up;\n\nthen, in connection with each such event, the Corporation shall send to the\n\nholders of Series B Preferred Stock:\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(i) at least twenty (20) days\u2019 prior written notice of the date on which a\n\nrecord shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights\n\n(and specifying the date on which the holders of common stock shall be\n\nentitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote, if any, in respect of the\n\nmatters referred to in (i) and (ii) above; and\n\n\n\n(ii) in the case of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above, at least\n\ntwenty (20) days\u2019 prior written notice of the date when the same shall take\n\nplace (and specifying the date on which the holders of common stock shall be\n\nentitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other consideration\n\nproperly deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).\n\n\n\n(g) Issue Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes\n\nthat may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common\n\nstock on conversion of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided,\n\nhowever, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes\n\nresulting from any transfer requested by any holder in connection with any\n\nsuch conversion.\n\n\n\n(h) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at\n\nall times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares\n\nof common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the\n\nshares of the Series B Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of common\n\nstock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all\n\noutstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock; and if at any time the\n\nnumber of authorized but unissued shares of common stock shall not be\n\nsufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as\n\nmay, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized\n\nbut unissued shares of common stock to such number of shares as shall be\n\nsufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best\n\nefforts to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of any necessary\n\namendment to the Articles of Incorporation.\n\n\n\n(i) Fractional Shares. No fractional share shall be required to be issued by\n\nthe Corporation upon the conversion of any share or shares of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock. All shares of common stock (including fractions thereof)\n\nissuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series B Preferred Stock by\n\na holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the\n\nconversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the\n\naforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a\n\nfraction of a share of common stock, the Corporation shall have the option, in\n\nlieu of issuing any fractional share, to pay the holder otherwise entitled to\n\nsuch fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such fraction on\n\nthe date of conversion (as determined in good faith by the Board).\n\n\n\n(j) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5.4 to be\n\ngiven to the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be deemed\n\ngiven if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or if sent by\n\nfacsimile or delivered personally by hand or nationally recognized courier and\n\naddressed to each holder of record at such holder\u2019s address or facsimile\n\nnumber appearing in the records of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSection 5.5. Voting Rights. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will have\n\nthe number of votes that the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion\n\nof a share of Series B Preferred Stock would have (referred to herein as\n\nvoting on an \u201cas converted\u201d basis). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock\n\nwill initially have 738.5 votes. The common stock, Series A Preferred Stock\n\nand Series B Preferred Stock will vote together as a single class, except in\n\nthe limited circumstances provided in Section 5.6 below or as required under\n\napplicable law.\n\n\n\nSection 5.6. Voting as Separate Class. Any amendment, modification or repeal\n\nof the terms of the Corporation\u2019s Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws\n\nrelating to the Series B Preferred Stock that would materially adversely\n\naffect the powers, preferences, or rights of the Series B Preferred Stock\n\nincluding but not limited to modifications resulting from or in connection\n\nwith any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the\n\nassets of the Corporation, will require the approval of holders of at least a\n\nmajority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock, if any, voting together as a separate class. In\n\naddition, without the affirmative vote or consent of holders of at least a\n\nmajority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B\n\nPreferred Stock, if any, voting together as a separate class, the Corporation\n\nshall not authorize, create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of\n\nany class or series of equity securities ranking senior or pari passu with the\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or the\n\ndistribution of assets upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up of the Corporation.\n\n\n\nSection 5.7. Optional Redemption.\n\n\n\n(a) Optional Redemption. The Corporation shall have the right to redeem the\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock at any time after the New Conversion Rights Date, in\n\nwhole or in part at any time concurrently with or after all of the\n\nCorporation\u2019s outstanding Senior Notes and Senior Convertible Notes (to the\n\nextent any such notes remain outstanding and have not been converted into\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock) have been repurchased, redeemed or otherwise repaid\n\nin full. Any such redemption shall be for a cash amount per share equal to the\n\nthen-effective liquidation preference, together with any accrued and\n\nundeclared dividends to the date of redemption. The Corporation will provide\n\nnotice of the optional redemption date at least 30 days in advance of such\n\ndate to all holders of Series B Preferred Stock showing on the registry books\n\nof the Corporation or the Transfer Agent as of such date and make such other\n\npublic announcement as it deems reasonable.\n\n\n\n(b) Conversion in Lieu of Redemption. The holders\u2019 option to convert shares of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock into shares of common stock of the Corporation will\n\nterminate at the close of business on the business day preceding the optional\n\nredemption date, unless the Corporation defaults in making any redemption\n\npayment upon such optional redemption date. Holders of the Series B Preferred\n\nStock shall have the right to exercise conversion rights in lieu of the\n\nreceipt of the redemption payment up to and including the business day\n\npreceding the optional redemption date.\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSection 5.8. Mandatory Redemption.\n\n\n\n(a) Mandatory Redemption Date. On the later of (i) March 15, 2011 and (ii) 120\n\ndays following the New Conversion Rights Date (the \u201cSeries B Mandatory\n\nRedemption Date\u201d), the Corporation must redeem all outstanding shares of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock for a cash redemption price per share equal to the\n\nthen-effective liquidation preference, together with any accrued and\n\nundeclared dividends to the date of redemption. In the event that the New\n\nConversion Rights Date has not occurred on or before March 15, 2011, then on\n\neach semi-annual dividend payment date on or after March 15, 2011, in the\n\nevent that any holder has given the Corporation at least 60 days notice prior\n\nto such dividend payment date, the Corporation will redeem such holders\u2019\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the then-effective\n\nliquidation preference, together with any accrued and undeclared dividends to\n\nthe date of redemption.\n\n\n\n(b) Insufficient or Unavailable Capital at the Mandatory Redemption Date. If\n\nat the Series B Mandatory Redemption Date, the Corporation does not have\n\nsufficient capital and surplus legally available to redeem all the outstanding\n\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take all reasonable\n\nmeasures permitted under the Georgia Business Corporation Code to increase the\n\namount of its capital and surplus legally available, and the Corporation will\n\nredeem as many shares of Series B Preferred Stock as it may legally redeem,\n\nratably (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares)\n\nfrom the holders thereof in proportion to the number of shares held by them,\n\nand shall thereafter from time to time, as soon as it shall have funds\n\navailable therefor, redeem as many shares of Series B Preferred Stock as it\n\nlegally may until it has redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(c) Conversion in Lieu of Redemption. The holders\u2019 option to convert shares of\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock into shares of common stock of the Corporation will\n\nterminate at the close of business on the business day preceding the Series B\n\nMandatory Redemption Date (subject to any extension necessary to permit the\n\nexpiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, if applicable),\n\nunless the Corporation defaults in making any redemption payment upon the\n\nSeries B Mandatory Redemption Date. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock\n\nshall have the right to exercise conversion rights in lieu of the receipt of\n\nthe redemption payment up to and including the business day preceding the\n\nSeries B Mandatory Redemption Date.\n\n\n\n(d) Notice. The Corporation will provide notice of the Mandatory Redemption\n\nDate at least 30 days in advance of such date to all holders of Series B\n\nPreferred Stock showing on the registry books of the Corporation or the\n\nTransfer Agent as of such date make such other public announcement as it deems\n\nreasonable.\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSection 5.9. Loss, Theft, Destruction of Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of\n\nevidence satisfactory to the Corporation of the loss, theft, destruction or\n\nmutilation of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and, in the case of any such\n\nloss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity or security reasonably\n\nsatisfactory to the Corporation, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon\n\nsurrender and cancellation of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Corporation\n\nshall make, issue and deliver, in lieu of such lost, stolen, destroyed or\n\nmutilated shares of Series B Preferred Stock, new shares of Series B Preferred\n\nStock of like tenor. The Series B Preferred Stock shall be held and owned upon\n\nthe express condition that the provisions of this Section 5.9 are exclusive\n\nwith respect to the replacement of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen shares\n\nof Series B Preferred Stock and shall preclude any and all other rights and\n\nremedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to\n\nthe contrary with respect to the replacement of negotiable instruments or\n\nother securities without the surrender thereof.\n\n\n\nSection 5.10. Register. The Corporation shall appoint a transfer agent\n\nregistered under the Exchange Act to keep at its principal office a register\n\nin which the Transfer Agent shall provide for the registration of the Series B\n\nPreferred Stock. The initial Transfer Agent shall be American Stock Transfer\n\nand Trust Company. Upon any transfer of the Series B Preferred Stock in\n\naccordance with the provisions hereof, the Transfer Agent shall register such\n\ntransfer on the Series B Preferred Stock register. The Corporation or the\n\nTransfer Agent may deem the person in whose name the Series B Preferred Stock\n\nshall be registered upon the registry books of the Corporation or the Transfer\n\nAgent to be, and may treat it as, the absolute owner of the Series B Preferred\n\nStock for the purpose of receiving payment of dividends on the Series B\n\nPreferred Stock, for the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and for\n\nall other purposes, and the Corporation or the Transfer Agent shall not be\n\naffected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments and such conversions\n\nshall be valid and effective to satisfy and discharge the liability upon the\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock to the extent of the sum or sums so paid or the\n\nconversion or conversions so made.\n\n\n\nSection 5.11. Form of Certificates. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock\n\nshall be certificated.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSection 5.12. Withholding. To the extent required by applicable law, the\n\nCorporation may withhold amounts for or on account of any taxes imposed or\n\nlevied by or on behalf of any taxing authority in the United States having\n\njurisdiction over the Corporation from any payments made pursuant to the\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSection 5.13.

Voting Rights.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(a) Except as otherwise required by law or as may be provided by the\n\nresolutions of the Board of Directors authorizing the issuance of any class or\n\nseries of Preferred Stock, as provided in Section A of this Article 2, all\n\nrights to vote and all voting power shall be vested exclusively in the holders\n\nof the Common Stock.\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(b) The holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on\n\nall matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corporation ( the\n\n\"Shareholders\"), including, without limitation, the election of directors.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2\\. Dividends. Except as otherwise provided by law or as may be provided by\n\nthe resolutions of the Board of Directors authorizing the issuance of any\n\nclass or series of Preferred Stock, as provided in Section A of this Article\n\n2, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pro-rata\n\nbasis, when, as and if provided by the Board of Directors, out of funds\n\nlegally available therefor, dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n3\\. Liquidating Distributions. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up\n\nof the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, and after payment or\n\nprovision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the corporation,\n\nand except as may be provided by the resolutions of the Board of Directors\n\nauthorizing the issuance of any class or series of Preferred Stock, as\n\nprovided in Section A of this Article2, the remaining assets of the\n\ncorporation shall be distributed pro-rata to the holders of the Common Stock.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nEach ten shares of the Common Stock issued as of the date and time immediately\n\npreceding 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on August 14, 2006, which is the\n\neffective date of a reverse stock split (the \u2018Split Effective Date\u2019), shall be\n\nautomatically changed and reclassified, as of the Split Effective Date and\n\nwithout further action, into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of the\n\nCommon Stock; provided, however, that there shall be no fractional interest\n\nresulting from such change and reclassification. In the case of any holder of\n\nfewer than ten shares of Common Stock or any number of shares of Common Stock\n\nwhich, when divided by ten, does not result in a whole number (a \u2018Fractional\n\nShare Holder\u2019), the fractional share interest of common stock held by such\n\nFractional Share Holder as a result of such change and reclassification shall\n\nbe rounded upward to the nearest whole share. Share interests due to rounding\n\nare given solely to save the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional\n\nshares and do not represent separately bargained for consideration. Each\n\nholder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to\n\nthe Split Effective Date represents outstanding shares of common stock (the\n\n\u2018Old Certificates,\u2019 whether one or more) shall be entitled to receive upon\n\nsurrender of such Old Certificates to the Corporation\u2019s transfer agent for\n\ncancellation, a certificate or certificates (the \u2018New Certificates,\u2019 whether\n\none or more) representing the number of whole shares of common stock into and\n\nfor which the shares of the common stock formerly represented by such Old\n\nCertificates so surrendered, are reclassified under the terms hereof.
