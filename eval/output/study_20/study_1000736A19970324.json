Such meeting shall be called\n\nfor a time not earlier than twenty (20) days and not later than sixty (60) days\n\nafter such order or request or, in default of the calling of such meeting\n\nwithin sixty (60) days after such order or request, such meeting may be called\n\non similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate\n\nnot less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred\n\nStock outstanding.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection\n\n4.2(a)(3)(C), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within\n\nsixty (60) days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual\n\nmeeting of the stockholders.\n\n\n\n                                  (D)      In any default period, the holders\n\nof Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable,\n\nshall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the\n\nholders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect\n\ntwo (2) Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the\n\nDirectors so elected by the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall continue\n\nin office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or\n\nuntil the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of\n\nDirectors may (except as provided in subsection 4.2(a)(3)(B) hereof) be filled\n\nby vote of a majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the\n\nholders of the class of stock which elected the Director whose office shall\n\nhave become vacant.  References in this Section 4.2(a)(3)(D) to Directors\n\nelected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include Directors\n\nelected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the\n\nforegoing sentence.\n\n\n\n                                  (E)      Immediately upon the expiration of a\n\ndefault period, (x) the right of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock as a\n\nclass to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by\n\nthe holders of Series C Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the\n\nnumber of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in this\n\nCertificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, irrespective of\n\nany increase made pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4.2(a)(3)(B) hereof\n\n(such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner\n\nprovided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws).  Any\n\nvacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y)\n\nand (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining\n\nDirectors.\n\n\n\n                          (4)     Except as set forth herein, holders of Series\n\nC Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall\n\nnot be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of\n\nCommon Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\n<PAGE>   6\n\n\n\n                 (b)      Dividends and Distribution.\n\n\n\n                          (1)     The holders of shares of Series C Preferred\n\nStock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of\n\nDirectors out of funds legally available for the purposes, quarterly dividends\n\npayable in cash on the last day of March, June, September and December in each\n\nyear (each such date being referred to herein as a \"Quarterly Dividend Payment\n\nDate\"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first\n\nissuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock, in an\n\namount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a)\n\n$.001 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, one\n\nhundred (100) times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and\n\none hundred (100) times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all\n\nnon-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in\n\nshares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common\n\nStock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, since\n\nthe immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to\n\nthe first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any\n\nshare or fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock.  In the event the\n\nCorporation shall, at any time after November 10, 1994 (the \"Rights Declaration\n\nDate\"), (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common\n\nStock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the\n\noutstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such\n\ncase the amount to which holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock were\n\nentitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding\n\nsentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the\n\nnumerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding\n\nimmediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n                          (2)     The Corporation shall declare a dividend or\n\ndistribution on the Series C Preferred Stock as provided in subsection\n\n4.2(b)(1) hereof immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on\n\nthe Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock);\n\nprovided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been\n\ndeclared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a\n\ndividend of $.001 per share on the Series C Preferred Stock shall nevertheless\n\nbe payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.\n\n\n\n                          (3)     Dividends shall begin to accrue and be\n\ncumulative on outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock from the Quarterly\n\nDividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series\n\nC Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the\n\nrecord date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case\n\ndividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such\n\nshares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is\n\na date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of\n\nSeries C Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before\n\nsuch Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends\n\nshall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment\n\nDate.

Following the payment of the\n\nfull amount of the Series C Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in\n\nrespect of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Common Stock,\n\nrespectively, holders of Series C Preferred Stock and holders of shares of\n\nCommon Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the\n\nremaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to one\n\n(1) with respect to such Series C Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per\n\nshare basis, respectively.\n\n\n\n                          (2)     In the event, however, that there are not\n\nsufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series C\n\nLiquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of\n\nPreferred Stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series C Preferred\n\nStock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratable to the holders\n\nof such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation\n\npreferences.  In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets\n\navailable to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such\n\nremaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.\n\n\n\n                          (3)     In the event the Corporation shall at any\n\ntime after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock\n\npayable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock,\n\nor (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,\n\nthen, in each such case, the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to\n\nsuch event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a\n\nfraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock\n\noutstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to\n\nsuch event.\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\n<PAGE>   9\n\n\n\n                 (f)      Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case the Corporation\n\nshall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in\n\nwhich the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock\n\nor securities, cash and/or any other property, then, in any such case, the\n\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly\n\nexchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for\n\nadjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to one hundred (100) times the\n\naggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable\n\nin kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common\n\nStock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time\n\nafter the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock\n\npayable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock,\n\nor (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,\n\nthen, in each such case, the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with\n\nrespect to the exchange or change of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall\n\nbe adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is\n\nthe number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event\n\nand the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n                 (g)      No Redemption.  The shares of Series C Preferred\n\nStock shall not be redeemable.\n\n\n\n                 (h)      Amendment.  The Certificate of Incorporation of the\n\nCorporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially\n\nalter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series C\n\nPreferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of\n\nthe holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series C\n\nPreferred Stock, voting separately as a class.\n\n\n\n                 (i)      Fractional Shares.  Series C Preferred Stock may be\n\nissued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to\n\nsuch holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, to receive\n\ndividends, to participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other\n\nrights of holders of Series C Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n         SECTION 4.3      OTHER PREFERRED STOCK.

Except as\n\notherwise provided by the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors\n\nproviding for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section\n\n4.3, in the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs\n\nof the Corporation, after distribution in full of the preferential amounts, if\n\nany, to be distributed to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, the\n\nrights of the holders of Common Stock to receive any remaining assets of the\n\nCorporation shall be as provided in subsection 4.2(e).\n\n\n\n                                   ARTICLE V\n\n\n\n         SECTION 5.1      GENERAL PROVISIONS.  The business and affairs of the\n\nCorporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe exact number of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by, or in the\n\nmanner provided in, the Bylaws of the Corporation, and may be increased or\n\ndecreased as therein provided.  Directors of the Corporation need not be\n\nelected by ballot unless required by the Bylaws.\n\n\n\n         SECTION 5.2      CLASSIFICATION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

Each such class shall consist, as\n\nnearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of Directors, and\n\nany remaining Directors shall be included within such groups as the Board of\n\nDirectors shall designate.  The first class of Directors will be elected for a\n\nterm which expires in 1996.  The second class will be elected for a term which\n\nexpires in 1997.  The third class will be elected to a term which expires in\n\n1998.  At each annual meeting of stockholders, beginning in 1996, successors to\n\nthe class of Directors whose term expires at the annual meeting shall be\n\nelected for a three-year term.  If the number of Directors is changed, any\n\nincrease or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain\n\nthe number of Directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no\n\ncase shall a decrease in the number of Directors shorten the term of any\n\nincumbent Director.  A Director may be removed from office for cause only and,\n\nsubject to such removal, death, resignation, retirement or disqualification,\n\nshall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term\n\nexpires and until his successor shall be elected and qualify.

To the extent that any holders of any class or series of stock\n\nother than Common Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the separate\n\nright, voting as a class or series, to elect Directors, the Directors elected\n\nby such class or series shall be deemed to constitute an additional class of\n\nDirectors and shall have a term of office for one year or such other period as\n\nmay be designated by the provisions of such class\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\n<PAGE>   12\n\n\n\nor series providing such separate voting right to the holders of such class or\n\nseries of stock, and any such class of Directors shall be in addition to the\n\nclasses designated above.\n\n\n\n         SECTION 5.4      NOMINATIONS.  Advance notice of nominations for the\n\nelection of Directors shall be given in the manner and to the extent provided\n\nin the Bylaws of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n         SECTION 5.5      VACANCIES.
