If a quorum is present,\n\nthe effective vote of a majority of the voting power represented at the meeting\n\nand entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders,\n\nunless the vote of a greater proportion or number is required by any provisions\n\ncontained in the NGCL. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in the NGCL\n\nrequiring the vote of shares possessing two-thirds of the voting power of\n\nEchoStar to take action, absent a provision herein to the contrary, in the case\n\nof such provisions the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power shall\n\nbe the act of the shareholders.\n\n\n\n                  (c) Holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to cumulate\n\ntheir votes in the election of directors and shall not be entitled to any\n\npreemptive rights to acquire shares of any class or series of capital stock of\n\nthe Corporation. Subject to any preferential rights of holders of Preferred\n\nStock, holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive their pro rata\n\nshares, based upon the number of shares of Common Stock held by them, of such\n\ndividends or other distributions as may be declared by the Board of Directors\n\nfrom time to time and of any distribution of the assets of the Corporation upon\n\nits liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary.\n\n\n\n         2.

In order to\n\nexercise the conversion privilege, a holder of Class B Common Stock or Class C\n\nCommon Stock shall surrender the certificate evidencing such Class B Common\n\nStock or Class C Common Stock to the Corporation at its principal office, duly\n\nendorsed to the Corporation and accompanied by written notice to the Corporation\n\nthat the holder thereof elects to convert a specified portion or all of such\n\nshares. Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nconverted at the option of the holder shall be deemed to have been converted on\n\nthe day of surrender of the certificate representing such shares for conversion\n\nin accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the\n\nholder of such Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as such holder,\n\nshall cease and such holder shall be treated for all purposes as the record\n\nholder of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion. As promptly as\n\npracticable on or after the conversion date, the Corporation shall issue and\n\nmail or deliver to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of\n\nClass A Common Stock issuable upon conversion, computed to the nearest one\n\nhundredth of a full share, and a certificate or certificates for the balance of\n\nClass B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock surrendered, if any, not so\n\nconverted into Class A Common Stock.\n\n\n\n                  (b) The Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock shall be\n\nconvertible into one share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B\n\nCommon Stock or Class C Common Stock so converted (the \"Conversion Rate\"). In\n\nthe event the Corporation shall at any time subdivide or split its outstanding\n\nClass A Common Stock, into a greater number of shares or declare any dividend\n\npayable in Class A Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior\n\nto such subdivision, split or dividend shall be proportionately increased, and\n\nconversely, in case the outstanding Class A Common Stock of the Corporation\n\nshall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Rate in effect\n\nimmediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately decreased.\n\n\n\n                  (c) Upon any adjustment of the Conversion Rate then and in\n\neach such case the Corporation shall give written notice thereof, by first-class\n\nmail, postage prepaid, addressed to the registered holders of Class B Common\n\nStock and Class C Common Stock at the addresses of such holders as shown on the\n\nbooks of the Corporation, which notice shall state the Conversion Rate resulting\n\nfrom such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of\n\nshares receivable at such price upon the conversion of Class B Common Stock or\n\nClass C Common Stock, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of\n\ncalculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based.\n\n\n\n                  (d) The holders of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common\n\nStock shall have the following rights to certain properties received by the\n\nholders of Class A Common Stock:\n\n\n\n                           (i) In case the Corporation shall declare a dividend\n\n         or distribution upon Class A Common Stock payable other than in cash\n\n         out of earnings or surplus or other than in Class A Common Stock, then\n\n         thereafter each holder of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock\n\n         upon the conversion thereof will be entitled to receive the number of\n\n         shares of Class A Common Stock into which such Class B Common Stock or\n\n         Class C Common Stock shall be converted, and, in addition and without\n\n         payment therefor, the property which such holder would have received as\n\n         a dividend if continuously since the record date for any such dividend\n\n         or distribution such holder: (A) had been the record holder of the\n\n         number of Class A\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n         Common Stock then received; and (B) had retained all dividends or\n\n         distributions originating directly or indirectly from such Class A\n\n         Common Stock.\n\n\n\n                           (ii) If any capital reorganization or\n\n         reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation, or\n\n         consolidation or merger of the Corporation with another corporation, or\n\n         the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to another\n\n         corporation shall be effected in such a way that holders of Class A\n\n         Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or assets\n\n         with respect to or in exchange for a Class A Common, then, as a\n\n         condition of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,\n\n         merger or sale, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the\n\n         holders of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock shall\n\n         thereafter have the right to receive, in lieu of Class A Common Stock\n\n         of the Corporation immediately theretofore receivable upon the\n\n         conversion of such Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock, such\n\n         shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with\n\n         respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding Class A Common\n\n         Stock equal to the number of Class A Common Stock immediately\n\n         theretofore receivable upon the conversion or such Class B Common Stock\n\n         and Class C Common Stock had such reorganization, reclassification,\n\n         consolidation, merger or sale not taken place, and in any such case\n\n         appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and\n\n         interests of the holders of the Class B Common Stock and Class C Common\n\n         Stock to the end that the provisions hereof (including without\n\n         limitation provisions for adjustments of the Conversion Rate and of the\n\n         number of shares receivable upon the conversion of such Class B Common\n\n         Stock and Class C Common Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as\n\n         nearly as may be, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or\n\n         assets thereafter receivable upon the conversion of such Class B Common\n\n         Stock and Class C Common Stock. The Corporation shall not effect any\n\n         such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale,\n\n         unless prior to the consummation thereof the surviving corporation (if\n\n         other than the Corporation), the corporation resulting from such\n\n         consolidation or the corporation purchasing such assets shall assume by\n\n         written instrument executed and mailed to the registered holders of the\n\n         Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock at the last address of\n\n         such holders appearing on the books of the Corporation, the obligation\n\n         to deliver to such holders such shares of stock, securities or assets\n\n         as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holders may be\n\n         entitled to receive.\n\n\n\n                  (e) In case at any time:\n\n\n\n                           (iii) the Corporation shall pay any dividend payable\n\n         in stock upon Class A Common Stock or make any distribution (other than\n\n         regular cash dividends to the holders of Class A Common Stock); or\n\n\n\n                           (iv) the Corporation shall offer for subscription pro\n\n         rata to the holders of Class A Common Stock any additional shares of\n\n         stock of any class or other rights; or\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n                           (v) there shall be any capital reorganization,\n\n         reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation, or\n\n         consolidation or merger of the Corporation with, or sale of all or\n\n         substantially all of its assets, to another corporation (provided\n\n         however, that this provision shall not be applicable to the merger or\n\n         consolidation of the Corporation with or into another corporation if,\n\n         following such merger or consolidation, the shareholders of the\n\n         Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation own at\n\n         least 80% of the equity of the combined entity); or\n\n\n\n                           (vi) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary\n\n         dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation;\n\n\n\nthen, in any one or more of the aforesaid cases, the Corporation shall give\n\nwritten notice, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders\n\nof Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock at the addresses of such\n\nholders as shown on the books of the Corporation, of the date on which: (A) the\n\nbooks of the Corporation shall close or a record shall be taken for such\n\ndividend, distribution or subscription rights; or (B) such reorganization,\n\nreclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or\n\nwinding up shall take place, as the case may be. Such notice shall also specify\n\nthe date as of which the holders of Class A Common Stock of record shall\n\nparticipate in such dividend, distribution, or subscription rights, or shall be\n\nentitled to exchange their Class A Common Stock for securities or other property\n\ndeliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,\n\nsale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, as the case may be.
