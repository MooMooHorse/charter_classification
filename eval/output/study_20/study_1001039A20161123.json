In the event the Corporation shall, at any time after\n\nthe issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series R Preferred Stock,\n\nmake any distribution on the shares of Common Stock, whether by way of a\n\ndividend or a reclassification of stock, a recapitalization, reorganization or\n\npartial liquidation of the Corporation or otherwise, which is payable in cash or\n\nany debt security, debt instrument, real or personal property or any other\n\nproperty (other than cash dividends subject to clause (i) of the immediately\n\npreceding sentence and other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock or\n\nother capital stock of the Corporation and other than a distribution of rights\n\nor warrants to acquire any such share, including any debt security convertible\n\ninto or exchangeable for any such share, at a price less than the Current Market\n\nPrice of such share), then and in each such event the Corporation shall\n\nsimultaneously pay on each then outstanding share of Series R Preferred Stock of\n\nthe Corporation a distribution, in like kind, of 400 times (subject to the\n\nprovisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth) such distribution paid on a\n\nshare of Common Stock.

The number of votes which a holder of Series R Preferred Stock\n\nis entitled to cast, as the same maybe adjusted from time to time as hereinafter\n\nprovided, is hereinafter referred to as the \"Vote Multiple.\" In the event the\n\nCorporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock\n\npayable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a\n\ncombination, consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common\n\nStock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each\n\nsuch case the Vote Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the\n\nnumber of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock\n\nshall be entitled after such event shall be the Vote Multiple immediately prior\n\nto such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the\n\ndenominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n     (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of\n\nshares of Series R Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock\n\nshall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of\n\nstockholders of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n     (C)  If at the time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the\n\nelection of directors a default in preference dividends on the Series R\n\nPreferred Stock shall exist, the number of directors constituting the Board of\n\nDirectors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the\n\nSeries R Preferred Stock, together with the holders of any other series of\n\nPreferred Stock of the Corporation who shall have been granted voting rights to\n\nelect directors upon a default in the payment of dividends by the Corporation\n\n(collectively with the holders of the Series R Preferred Stock, the \"Preferred\n\nStockholders\"), shall have the right at such meeting, voting together as a\n\nsingle class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of Common\n\nStock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created\n\ndirectorships. Such right shall continue until there are no dividends in arrears\n\nupon the Series R Preferred Stock. Each director elected by the Preferred\n\nStockholders (herein called a \"Preferred Director\") shall continue to serve as\n\nsuch director for the full term for which he shall have been elected,\n\nnotwithstanding that prior to the end of such term a default in preference\n\ndividends shall cease to exist. Any Preferred Director may be removed by, and\n\nshall not be removed without cause except by, the vote of the Preferred\n\nStockholders, voting together as a single class without regard to series, at a\n\nmeeting of the stockholders, or of the Preferred Stockholders, called for the\n\npurpose. So long as a default in any preference dividends on the Series R\n\nPreferred Stock shall exist (i) any vacancy in the office of a Preferred\n\nDirector may be filled (except as provided in the following clause (ii)) by an\n\ninstrument in writing signed by the remaining Preferred Director and filed with\n\nthe Corporation and (ii) in case of the removal of any Preferred Director, the\n\nvacancy may be filled by the vote of the Preferred Stockholders, voting together\n\nas a single class without regard to series, at the same meeting at which such\n\nremoval shall be voted. Each director appointed as aforesaid by the remaining\n\nPreferred Director shall be deemed, for all purposes hereof, to be a Preferred\n\nDirector. Whenever the term of office of the Preferred Directors shall end and a\n\ndefault in preference dividends shall no longer exist, the number of directors\n\nconstituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced by two. For the purposes\n\nhereof, a \"default in preference dividends\" on the Series R Preferred Stock\n\nshall be deemed to have occurred whenever the amount of accrued dividends upon\n\nthe Series R Preferred Stock shall be equivalent to six full quarter yearly\n\ndividends or more and, having so occurred, such default shall be deemed to exist\n\nthereafter until, but only until, all accrued dividends on all shares of Series\n\nR Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been paid to the end of the last\n\npreceding quarterly dividend period.\n\n\n\n     (D)  Except as otherwise required by law or set forth herein, holders\n\nof Series R Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their\n\nconsent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote\n\nwith holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for the taking of any\n\ncorporate action.\n\n\n\n     Section 4. Certain Restrictions.\n\n                ---------------------\n\n\n\n     (A)  Whenever Preferential Dividends or Participating Dividends are in\n\narrears or the Corporation shall be in default in payment thereof, thereafter\n\nand until all accumulated and unpaid Preferential Dividends and Participating\n\nDividends, whether or not declared, on shares of Series R Preferred Stock\n\noutstanding shall have been paid or set aside for payment in full, and in\n\naddition to any and all other rights which any holder of shares of Series R\n\nPreferred Stock may have in such circumstances, the Corporation shall not:\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\n<PAGE>\n\n \n\n          (i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on or\n\n     redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of\n\n     stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\n\n     dissolution or winding up) to the Series R Preferred Stock;\n\n\n\n          (ii) declare or pay dividends or make any other distributions on any\n\n     shares of stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series R\n\n     Preferred Stock, unless dividends are paid ratably on the Series R\n\n     Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or\n\n     in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all\n\n     such shares are then entitled;\n\n\n\n          (iii) except as permitted by subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph (A),\n\n     redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any\n\n     stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\n\n     dissolution or winding up) with the Series R Preferred Stock, provided that\n\n     the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire\n\n     shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the\n\n     Corporation ranking junior (both as to dividends and upon liquidation,\n\n     dissolution or winding up) to the Series R Preferred Stock; or\n\n\n\n          (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of\n\n     Series R Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with\n\n     the Series R Preferred Stock (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\n\n     dissolution or winding up), except in accordance with a purchase offer made\n\n     in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to\n\n     all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after\n\n     consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative\n\n     rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall\n\n     determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among\n\n     the respective series or classes.\n\n\n\n     (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to\n\npurchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the\n\nCorporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4,\n\npurchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.\n\n\n\n     (C)  The Corporation shall not issue any shares of Series R Preferred Stock\n\nexcept upon exercise of Rights issued pursuant to that certain Rights Agreement\n\ndated as of November 8, 1995 between the Corporation and The Bank of New York\n\n(the \"Rights Agreement\"), a copy of which is on file at the principal executive\n\noffice of the Corporation and shall be made available to holders of record of\n\nCommon Stock or Series R Preferred Stock without charge upon written request\n\ntherefor addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation.   Notwithstanding the\n\nforegoing sentence, nothing contained in the provisions hereof shall prohibit or\n\nrestrict the Corporation from issuing for any purpose any series of Preferred\n\nStock with rights and privileges similar to, different from, or greater than\n\nthose of the Series R Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n     Section 5.

The\n\nCorporation shall cause all such shares upon their retirement and cancellation\n\nto become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation\n\nas to series, and such shares may be reissued as part of a new series of\n\nPreferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of\n\nDirectors.\n\n\n\n     Section 6.

For purposes of this paragraph, the\n\n\"Discount Fraction\" shall be a fraction the numerator of which shall be the\n\ndifference between the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of a share\n\nof the capital stock subject to a right or warrant distributed to holders of\n\nshares of Common Stock as contemplated by this paragraph immediately after the\n\ndistribution thereof and the purchase price per share for such share of capital\n\nstock pursuant to such right or warrant and the denominator of which shall be\n\nthe Current Market Price of a share of such capital stock immediately after the\n\ndistribution of such right or warrant.\n\n\n\n     (D)  For purposes of this Section 7, the \"Current Market Price\" of a share\n\nof capital stock of the Corporation (including a share of Common Stock) on any\n\ndate shall be deemed to be the average of the  daily closing prices per share\n\nthereof over the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter\n\ndefined) immediately prior to such date, provided that in the event that such\n\nCurrent Market Price of any such share of capital stock is determined during a\n\nperiod which includes any date that is within 30 Trading Days after the ex-\n\ndividend date for (i) a dividend or distribution on stock payable in shares of\n\nsuch stock or securities convertible into shares of such stock or (ii) any\n\nsubdivision, split, combination, consolidation, reverse stock split or\n\nreclassification of such stock, then in each such event, the Current Market\n\nPrice shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors to reflect the\n\nCurrent Market Price of such stock to take into account ex-dividend trading.\n\nThe closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in\n\ncase no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and\n\nasked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principle\n\nconsolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or\n\nadmitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the shares are not\n\nlisted or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the\n\nprincipal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities\n\nlisted on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are\n\nlisted or admitted to trading or, if the shares are not listed or admitted to\n\ntrading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so\n\nquoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter\n\nmarket, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.\n\nAutomated Quotation System (\"NASDAQ\") or such other system then in use, or if on\n\nany such date the shares are not quoted by any such organization, the average of\n\nthe closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker\n\nmaking a market in the shares selected by the Board of Directors.  The term\n\n\"Trading Day\" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities\n\nexchange on which the shares are listed or admitted to trading is open for the\n\ntransaction of business or, if the shares are not listed or admitted to trading\n\non any national securities exchange, on which the New York Stock Exchange or\n\nsuch other national securities exchange as may be selected by the Board of\n\nDirectors is open.  If the shares are not publicly held or not so listed or\n\ntraded on any day within the period of 30 Trading Days applicable to the\n\ndetermination of Current Market Price thereof as aforesaid, \"Current Market\n\nPrice\" shall mean the fair market value thereof per share as determined in good\n\nfaith by the Board of Directors.  In either case referred to in the foregoing\n\nsentence, the determination of Current Market Price shall be described in a\n\nstatement filed with the Secretary of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n     Section 8.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In the event that the Corporation\n\n                 --------------------------                                    \n\nshall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in\n\nwhich shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or\n\nsecurities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such event each\n\noutstanding share of Series R Preferred Stock shall at the same time be\n\nsimilarly exchanged for or changed into the aggregate amount of stock,\n\nsecurities, cash and other property (payable in like kind), as the case may be,\n\nfor which or into which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged\n\nmultiplied by the higher of the Dividend Multiple, the Liquidation Multiple or\n\nthe Vote Multiple in effect immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n     Section 9.  Effective Time of Adjustments.\n\n                 ----------------------------- \n\n\n\n     (A)   Adjustments to the Series R Preferred Stock required by the\n\nprovisions hereof shall be effective as of the time at which the event requiring\n\nsuch adjustments occurs.\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\n<PAGE>\n\n \n\n     (B)  The Corporation shall give prompt written notice to each holder of a\n\nshare of Series R Preferred Stock of the effect on any such shares of any\n\nadjustment to the dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or\n\nwinding up of the Corporation required by the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding\n\nthe foregoing sentence, the failure of the Corporation to give such notice shall\n\nnot affect the validity of or the force or effect of or the requirement for such\n\nadjustment.\n\n\n\n     Section 10.  No Redemption.  The  shares of Series R Preferred Stock shall\n\n                  -------------                                                \n\nnot be redeemable at the option of the Corporation or any holder thereof.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing sentence of this Section, the Corporation may\n\nacquire shares of Series R Preferred Stock in any other manner permitted by law\n\nor the provisions hereof.\n\n\n\n     Section 11.  Ranking.  Unless otherwise provided in the Restated\n\n                  --------                                           \n\nCertificate of Incorporation or a Certificate of Designation relating to a\n\nsubsequent series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, the Series R Preferred\n\nStock shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock\n\nas to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up and senior to the Common Stock.\n\n\n\n     Section 12.  Amendment.  After the Distribution Date (as defined in the\n\n                  ---------                                                 \n\nRights Agreement), the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation\n\nshall not be amended in any manner which would materially affect the rights,\n\nprivileges or powers of the Series R Preferred Stock without, in addition to any\n\nother vote of stockholders required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders\n\nof 80% or more of the outstanding shares of Series R Preferred Stock, voting\n\ntogether as a single class.\n\n\n\n     FIFTH:  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or\n\nunder the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than nine\n\ndirectors nor more than twenty-one directors, the exact number of directors to\n\nbe determined from time to time solely by resolution adopted by the Board of\n\nDirectors.  The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class\n\nI, Class II and Class III.  Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be\n\npossible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire\n\nBoard of Directors.  The term of the initial Class I directors shall terminate\n\non the date of the 1997 annual meeting of stockholders; the term of the initial\n\nClass II directors shall terminate on the date of the 1998 annual meeting of\n\nstockholders; and the term of the initial Class III directors shall terminate on\n\nthe date of the 1999 annual meeting of stockholders.  At each annual meeting of\n\nstockholders, beginning with the 1997 annual meeting of stockholders, successors\n\nto the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be\n\nelected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of\n\nstockholders. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease\n\nshall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors\n\nin each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional directors of any\n\nclass elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall\n\nhold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that\n\nclass, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the\n\nterm of any incumbent director.  A director shall hold office until the annual\n\nmeeting for the year in which his term expires and until his successor shall be\n\nelected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation,\n\nretirement, disqualification or removal from office.  Any vacancy on the Board\n\nof Directors, howsoever resulting, may be filled solely by a majority of the\n\ndirectors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining\n\ndirector. Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for a term\n\nthat shall coincide with the term of the class to which such director shall have\n\nbeen elected.\n\n\n\n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more\n\nclasses or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the\n\nright, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or\n\nspecial meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of\n\nvacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the\n\nterms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the resolution or\n\nresolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article FOURTH\n\napplicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into\n\nclasses pursuant to this Article FIFTH unless expressly provided by such terms.\n\n\n\n     SIXTH: Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred\n\nStock then outstanding, from and after the time that shares of Common Stock are\n\nfirst issued, any or all of the directors of the Corporation may be removed from\n\noffice at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the\n\nholders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation then entitled\n\nto vote generally in the election of directors, considered for purposes of this\n\nArticle SIXTH as one class.\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\n<PAGE>\n\n \n\n     SEVENTH:  Elections of directors at an annual or special meeting of\n\nstockholders shall be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation\n\nshall otherwise provide.\n\n\n\n     EIGHTH:  Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any\n\npurpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors or the President.   Special meetings of the\n\nstockholders of the Corporation may not be called by any other person or\n\npersons.\n\n\n\n     NINTH:  A.  Except as set forth in Section B of this Article NINTH, the\n\naffirmative vote of the holders of four-fifths (4/5) of the outstanding stock of\n\nthe Corporation entitled to vote shall be required for:\n\n\n\n          (i) any merger or consolidation to which the Corporation, or any of\n\n     its subsidiaries, and an Interested Person (as hereinafter defined) are\n\n     parties;\n\n\n\n          (ii) any sale or other disposition by the Corporation, or any of its\n\n     subsidiaries, of all or substantially all of its assets to an Interested\n\n     Person;\n\n\n\n          (iii) any purchase or other acquisition by the Corporation, or any of\n\n     its subsidiaries, of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of an\n\n     Interested Person; and\n\n\n\n          (iv) any other transaction with an Interested Person which requires\n\n     the approval of the stockholders of the Corporation under the GCL.\n\n\n\n     B. The provisions of Section A of this Article NINTH shall not be\n\napplicable to any transaction described therein if (i) such transaction is\n\napproved by resolution of the Corporation's Board of Directors, provided that a\n\nmajority of the members of the Board of Directors voting for the approval of\n\nsuch transaction were duly elected and acting members of the Board of Directors\n\nprior to the date that the person, firm or corporation, or any group thereof,\n\nwith whom such transaction is proposed, became an Interested Person, or (ii) the\n\nprovision of a vote in excess of that required by the GCL for such transaction\n\nviolates the express provisions of the GCL.\n\n\n\n     C. As used in this Article NINTH, the term \"Interested Person\" shall mean\n\nany person, firm or corporation, or any group thereof, acting or intending to\n\nact in concert, including any person directly or indirectly controlling or\n\ncontrolled by or under direct or indirect common control with such person, firm\n\nor corporation or group, which owns of record or beneficially, directly or\n\nindirectly, five percent (5%) or more of any class of voting securities of the\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n     D. The affirmative vote of the owners of four-fifths (4/5) of the\n\noutstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote shall be required to\n\namend, alter or repeal this Article NINTH.\n\n\n\n     TENTH: The officers of the Corporation shall be chosen in such a manner,\n\nshall hold their offices for such terms and shall carry out such duties as are\n\ndetermined solely by the Board of Directors, subject to the right of the Board\n\nof Directors to remove any officer or officers at any time with or without\n\ncause.\n\n\n\n     ELEVENTH: A.

No amendment\n\nor repeal of this Section A of Article ELEVENTH shall apply to or have any\n\neffect on any right to indemnification provided hereunder with respect to any\n\nacts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.\n\n\n\n     B. A director of this Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or\n\nits stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a\n\ndirector, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation\n\nthereof is not permitted under the GCL.\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\n<PAGE>\n\n \n\n     Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph shall not adversely\n\naffect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing\n\nhereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or\n\nmodification.\n\n\n\n     C. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute:\n\n\n\n          (i) the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of\n\n     any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the\n\n     Corporation, or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,\n\n     officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint\n\n     venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any\n\n     liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or\n\n     arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would\n\n     have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions\n\n     of law; and\n\n\n\n          (ii) the Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security\n\n     interest and/or use other means (including, without limitation, letters of\n\n     credit, surety bonds and/or other similar arrangements), as well as enter\n\n     into contracts providing indemnification to the full extent authorized or\n\n     permitted by law and including as part thereof provisions with respect to\n\n     any or all of the foregoing to ensure the payment of such amounts as may\n\n     become necessary to effect indemnification as provided therein, or\n\n     elsewhere.\n\n\n\n     TWELFTH:  In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by\n\nstatute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, repeal, alter,\n\namend or rescind the Bylaws of the Corporation.
