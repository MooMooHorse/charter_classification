Liquidation Rights. The amount payable on shares of Series\n\n     1 in the event of any voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of\n\n     the affairs of the Corporation prior to March 15, 1974 shall be $112.00 per\n\n     share and thereafter shall be an amount equal to the redemption price for\n\n     shares of Series 1 in effect on the distribution date, and in the event of\n\n     any involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation\n\n     shall be $104.00 per share.\n\n \n\n        SECTION 7.  Conversion Right.\n\n \n\n          (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section\n\n     7, shares of Series 1 may, at the option of the holder at any time (or, in\n\n     the case of shares called for redemption, then until and including the\n\n     close of business on the date fixed for redemption but not thereafter if\n\n     payment of the redemption price has been duly provided for by the date\n\n     fixed for redemption), be converted into shares of Common Stock (as such\n\n     shares shall be constituted at the conversion date) at the conversion price\n\n     in effect at the conversion date.\n\n \n\n          (b) The holder of each share of Series 1 may exercise the conversion\n\n     privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any transfer agent of Series\n\n     1 the share to be converted, accompanied by written notice that the holder\n\n     elects to convert such share. Conversion shall be deemed to have been\n\n     effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date when such\n\n     delivery is made, and such date is referred to in this Section as the\n\n     \"conversion date\". On the conversion date or as promptly thereafter as\n\n     practicable, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the holder of\n\n     shares of Series 1 surrendered for conversion, or on his written order, a\n\n     certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the\n\n     conversion of such shares of Series 1 and a check or cash in respect of any\n\n     fraction of a share as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 7. The\n\n     person in whose name the stock certificate is to be issued shall be deemed\n\n     to have become a holder of Common Stock of record on the conversion date.\n\n     No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on such shares of Series 1 or\n\n     for dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued on conversion.\n\n \n\n          (c) The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractional shares\n\n     of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series 1. If more than one\n\n     share of Series 1 shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the\n\n     same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon\n\n     conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number\n\n     of shares so surrendered. If any fractional interest in a share of Common\n\n     Stock would be deliverable upon the conversion of any shares of Series 1,\n\n     the Corporation shall, in lieu of delivering the fractional share therefor,\n\n     make an adjustment therefor in cash at the current market value thereof,\n\n     computed on the basis of the last reported sale price of the shares of\n\n     Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day before\n\n     the conversion date or, if there was no reported sale on that day, on the\n\n     basis of the mean of the closing bid and asked quotations on that Exchange\n\n     on that day, or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on that Exchange,\n\n     on the basis of the mean of the closing bid and asked quotations in the\n\n     over-the-counter market on that day, as reported by the National Quotation\n\n     Bureau, or similar reporting service.\n\n \n\n          (d) Unless and until an adjusted conversion price of the Common Stock\n\n     is required to be computed as hereinafter provided, the conversion price\n\n     for such Common Stock shall be $90.909 per share (this initial conversion\n\n     price being herein called the \"base conversion price\"). The number of\n\n     shares of\n\n \n\n                                       12\n\n<PAGE>   14\n\n \n\n     Common Stock issuable upon conversion of one share of Series 1 shall be\n\n     determined by dividing $100 by the conversion price then in effect.\n\n \n\n          (e) The conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time as\n\n     follows:\n\n \n\n             (A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C), (E) and (F) below,\n\n        whenever the Corporation shall issue or sell any Additional Shares as\n\n        hereinafter defined for a consideration per share less than the\n\n        conversion price then in effect, or without consideration, the\n\n        conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance shall\n\n        forthwith be adjusted as follows:\n\n \n\n                (1) multiply the base conversion price by the sum of (i) the\n\n           total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (excluding shares\n\n           held in the Corporation's treasury) on November 16, 1967 and (ii) the\n\n           total number of shares of Common Stock issuable on November 16, 1967\n\n           upon conversion of any shares of Serial Preference Stock then\n\n           outstanding (the sum of such shares being herein called the \"Base\n\n           Shares\"), then\n\n \n\n                (2) add to the result so obtained the total consideration\n\n           received by the Corporation for all Additional Shares, and then\n\n \n\n                (3) divide such result by the sum of the number of Base Shares\n\n           and the number of Additional Shares, disregarding in the quotient so\n\n           obtained fractions of one cent;\n\n \n\n        provided, however, that such adjustment shall be made only if the\n\n        resulting quotient shall be less than the conversion price in effect\n\n        immediately prior to the issue or sale of such Additional Shares.\n\n \n\n             (B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A) above, the following\n\n        provisions shall be applicable:\n\n \n\n                (1) The term \"Additional Shares\" shall mean all shares of Common\n\n           Stock issued by the Corporation (whether or not the consideration\n\n           therefor, if any, is less per share than the base conversion price)\n\n           in excess of the Base Shares, whether or not subsequently reacquired\n\n           or retired by the Corporation, other than:\n\n \n\n                    (i) shares now or hereafter held in the Corporation's\n\n               treasury;\n\n \n\n                    (ii) shares issued pursuant to any employees' stock purchase\n\n               plan or any employees' stock option plan heretofore or hereafter\n\n               adopted or approved by the shareholders of the Corporation and\n\n               shares issued pursuant to any employees' stock purchase plan or\n\n               employees' stock option agreement heretofore or hereafter assumed\n\n               by the Corporation, including in the case of any plan or\n\n               agreement covered by this clause (ii) shares of Common Stock\n\n               issued upon the conversion of convertible securities so issued;\n\n \n\n                    (iii) except as provided in paragraph (4) below, shares of\n\n               Common Stock issued in connection with the acquisition by the\n\n               Corporation of the properties, assets and business of another\n\n               corporation, firm or other entity as a going concern (whether\n\n               such acquisition is by way of a merger, combination or majority\n\n               share acquisition or otherwise) and shares of Common Stock issued\n\n               upon conversion of any convertible

acquisition\" shall have the\n\n               meanings set forth in Section 1701.01 of the Ohio Revised Code);\n\n               and\n\n \n\n                    (iv) shares issued by way of dividend

this clause (iv) or on shares resulting from any subdivision or\n\n               combination of shares so excluded.\n\n \n\n                (2) In case of the issuance or sale of Additional Shares for\n\n           cash, the consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the amount of\n\n           cash received by the Corporation for such shares (or, if such\n\n           Additional Shares are offered by the Corporation for subscription,\n\n           the subscription price, or, if such Additional Shares are sold to\n\n           underwriters or dealers for public offering without a subscription\n\n           offering, the initial public offering price), without deducting\n\n           therefrom any\n\n \n\n                                       13\n\n<PAGE>   15\n\n \n\n

the Corporation in\n\n           connection therewith.\n\n \n\n                (3) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) below, in the\n\n           case of issuance or sale of Additional Shares for a consideration\n\n           other than cash, the amount of such consideration shall be deemed to\n\n           be the fair value thereof as determined by the Directors of the\n\n           Corporation, for purposes of this subparagraph (B), irrespective of\n\n           any accounting treatment.\n\n \n\n                (4) Subject to clause (iii) of this paragraph (4):\n\n \n\n                    (i) any shares of Common Stock issued in connection with any\n\n               merger of IRC, Inc. into the Corporation shall constitute\n\n               Additional Shares and shall be deemed to have been issued for a\n\n               consideration equal to the conversion price in effect immediately\n\n               prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares;\n\n \n\n                    (ii) in the case of the issuance of any shares of Preference\n\n               Stock II in connection with any merger of United-Carr\n\n               Incorporated or IRC, Inc. into the Corporation, any shares of\n\n               Common Stock into which such shares of Preference Stock II are\n\n               initially convertible shall constitute Additional Shares and\n\n               shall be deemed to have been issued at the time of the issuance\n\n               of such shares of Preference Stock II for a consideration equal\n\n               to the conversion price of Series 1 in effect immediately prior\n\n               to the issuance of such shares of Preference Stock II; and\n\n \n\n                    (iii) no shares of Common Stock covered by clauses (i) or\n\n               (ii) of this paragraph (4) in excess of an aggregate of 1,221,569\n\n               shares (proportionately adjusted to reflect any split or\n\n               combination of, or stock dividend paid on, the Common Stock prior\n\n               to the effective dates of said mergers) shall at any time\n\n               constitute Additional Shares.\n\n \n\n                (5) In the case of issuance of Additional Shares as a stock\n\n           dividend of 15% or less, the shares shall be deemed to have been\n\n           issued without consideration at the close of business on the dividend\n\n           record date.\n\n \n\n                (6) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) above, in the\n\n           case of the issuance of Additional Shares upon conversion or exchange\n\n           of other securities of the Corporation, the amount of consideration\n\n           received by the Corporation shall be deemed to be the total of (a)\n\n           the amount of consideration, if any, received by the Corporation upon\n\n           the issuance of such other securities, plus (b) the amount of the\n\n           consideration, if any, other than such other securities, received by\n\n           the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange. In determining the\n\n           amount of the consideration received by the Corporation upon the\n\n           issuance of such other securities, the amount of the consideration in\n\n           cash and other than cash shall be determined pursuant to paragraphs\n\n           (2) and (3) above. If securities of the same class or series of a\n\n           class as such other securities were issued for different amounts of\n\n           consideration (determined as above provided), or if some were issued\n\n           for no consideration, then the amount of the consideration received\n\n           by the Corporation upon the issuance of each of the securities of\n\n           such class or series, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the\n\n           average amount of the consideration received by the Corporation upon\n\n           the issuance of all the securities of such class or series, as the\n\n           case may be.\n\n \n\n             (C) If, at any time after November 16, 1967, the Corporation splits\n\n        or combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then as of the close\n\n        of business on the effective date of such split or combination the\n\n        conversion price shall be proportionately decreased in the case of a\n\n        split or increased in the case of a combination. A stock dividend of\n\n        more than 15% shall be considered a stock split, and the effective date\n\n        shall be deemed to be the close of business on the dividend record date.\n\n \n\n             (D) Whenever the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided,\n\n        the Corporation shall forthwith place on file with each transfer agent\n\n        of shares of Series 1 a statement signed by the President or a Vice\n\n        President of the Corporation and by its Treasurer or an Assistant\n\n        Treasurer\n\n \n\n                                       14\n\n<PAGE>   16\n\n \n\n        showing in detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the conversion\n\n        price after such adjustment and shall exhibit the same from time to time\n\n        to any holder of shares of Series 1 desiring an inspection thereof. The\n\n        Corporation shall also cause a notice, stating that such adjustment has\n\n        been effected and setting forth the adjusted conversion price, to be\n\n        published at least once in a newspaper printed in the English language\n\n        and customarily published at least once a day for at least five days in\n\n        each calendar week, which shall be of general circulation in the Borough\n\n        of Manhattan, the City of New York (herein called an \"Authorized\n\n        Newspaper\").\n\n \n\n             (E) In the case of the issuance of Additional Shares upon\n\n        conversion or exchange of other securities of the Corporation as\n\n        provided in paragraph (6) of subparagraph (B) above, the conversion\n\n        price shall be adjusted to reflect the issuance of such Additional\n\n        Shares only on the 15th day of each calendar month to reflect all such\n\n        conversions or exchanges through the preceding calendar month. Upon the\n\n        redemption of any shares of Series 1, the conversion price shall be\n\n        adjusted to reflect the issuance of such Additional Shares as of a date\n\n        not earlier than the close of business on the fifth business day\n\n        preceding the mailing of the notice of redemption.\n\n \n\n             (F) No adjustment of the conversion price shall be made if the\n\n        amount of such adjustment shall be less than 50c, but in such case any\n\n        adjustment that would otherwise be required then to be made shall be\n\n        carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the\n\n        next subsequent adjustment, which, together with all adjustments so\n\n        carried forward shall amount to not less than 50c. In case the\n\n        Corporation shall at any time split or combine the outstanding shares of\n\n        Common Stock, said amount of 50c (as theretofore decreased or increased)\n\n        shall forthwith be proportionately decreased in the case of a split or\n\n        increased in the case of a combination, so as to appropriately reflect\n\n        the same. For this purpose, a stock dividend of more than 15% shall be\n\n        considered a split of the outstanding shares.\n\n \n\n          (f) In case of any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of\n\n     Common Stock (except a split or combination, or a change in par value, or a\n\n     change from par value to no par value, or a change from no par value to par\n\n     value), or in case of any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation\n\n     is a party (other than a merger in which the Corporation is the surviving\n\n     corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change of\n\n     the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation except as stated above), or\n\n     in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the property of\n\n     the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, lawful\n\n     provision shall be made as part of the terms of such reclassification,\n\n     change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance that the holder of each\n\n     share of Series 1 then outstanding shall have the right to convert such\n\n     share into the same kind and amount of stock and other securities and\n\n     property as would be receivable upon such reclassification, change,\n\n     consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of\n\n     shares of Common Stock into which such share might have been converted\n\n     immediately prior thereto.\n\n \n\n          As evidence of the kind and amount of stock or other securities or\n\n     property into which shares of Series 1 shall be convertible after any such\n\n     reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, or as\n\n     to the appropriate adjustments of the conversion price applicable with\n\n     respect thereto, the transfer agents may accept the certificate of any firm\n\n     of independent public accountants (who may be the regular auditors retained\n\n     by the Corporation) with respect thereto, who as to questions of law may\n\n     request and rely upon an opinion of counsel (who may be counsel for the\n\n     Corporation) and in the absence of bad faith upon the part of the transfer\n\n     agents, they may conclusively rely thereon, and shall not be responsible or\n\n     accountable to any holder of shares of Series 1 for any provision in\n\n     conformity therewith, or approved by such firm of independent public\n\n     accountants.\n\n \n\n          (g) The issue of stock certificates on conversions of shares of Series\n\n     1 shall be without charge to the converting shareholder for any tax in\n\n     respect of the issue thereof. The Corporation shall not, however, be\n\n     required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer\n\n     involved in the issue and delivery of shares in any name other than that of\n\n     the holder of the shares of Series 1 converted, and the Corporation shall\n\n     not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and\n\n     until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to\n\n     the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the\n\n     satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.\n\n \n\n                                       15\n\n<PAGE>   17\n\n \n\n          (h) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available,\n\n     free from pre-emptive rights, out of its authorized and unissued stock or\n\n     out of shares held in its treasury, for the purpose of effecting the\n\n     conversion of shares of Series 1 such number of shares of its Common Stock\n\n     as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all\n\n     outstanding shares of Series 1.\n\n \n\n          (i) In case at any time:\n\n \n\n             (1) the Corporation shall pay any dividend upon its Common Stock\n\n        payable in shares of its Common Stock and such dividend shall be in\n\n        excess of five per cent (5%); or\n\n \n\n             (2) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to the holders of\n\n        its Common Stock of rights to subscribe for or purchase any shares of\n\n        any class or of any other rights;\n\n \n\n     then, in either of said cases, the Corporation shall give written notice,\n\n     by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of shares of\n\n     Series 1 at his address then appearing on the books of the Corporation, of\n\n     the record date or of the date on which the transfer books of the\n\n     Corporation shall close with respect to such action.

Conversion Right.\n\n \n\n          (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section\n\n     7, shares of Series 3 may, at the option of the holder at any time (or, in\n\n     the case of shares called for redemption, then until and including the\n\n     close of business on the date fixed for redemption but not thereafter if\n\n     payment of the redemption price has been duly provided for by the date\n\n     fixed for redemption), be converted into fully paid and non-assessable\n\n     shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock at\n\n     the rate of 1.862 shares of Common Stock for each share of Series 3.\n\n \n\n          (b) The holder of each share of Series 3 may exercise the conversion\n\n     privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any transfer agent of Series\n\n     3 the share to be converted accompanied by written notice that the holder\n\n     elects to convert such share.

The\n\n     person in whose name the stock certificate is to be issued shall be deemed\n\n     to have become a holder of Common Stock of record on the conversion date.\n\n     No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on such shares of Series 3 or\n\n     for dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued on conversion.\n\n \n\n                                       17\n\n<PAGE>   19\n\n \n\n          (c) The number of shares of Common Stock and the number of shares of\n\n     other classes of stock of the Corporation, if any, into which each share of\n\n     Series 3 is convertible shall be subject to adjustment from time to time\n\n     only as follows:\n\n \n\n             (A) In case the Corporation shall at any time or times after June\n\n        10, 1968 (1) take a record of the holders of Common Stock for the\n\n        purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend declared payable in\n\n        shares of Common Stock and thereafter pay such dividend, (2) subdivide\n\n        or split the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (3) combine the\n\n        outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or\n\n        (4) issue by reclassification of Common Stock any shares of the\n\n        Corporation, each holder of a share of Series 3 shall thereafter be\n\n        entitled upon the conversion of each share thereof held by him to\n\n        receive for each such share the number of shares of the Corporation\n\n        which he would have owned or have been entitled to receive in respect\n\n        thereof after the happening of the event or events described above which\n\n        shall have happened had such share of Series 3 been converted prior to\n\n        the happening of such event or events, the adjustment to become\n\n        effective immediately at the opening of business on the day next\n\n        following (x) the record date for purposes of clause (1), or (y) the day\n\n        upon which such subdivision, split, combination or reclassification\n\n        shall become effective for purposes of clauses (2), (3) and (4).\n\n \n\n             (B) In case the Corporation shall at any time or times after June\n\n        10, 1968 take a record of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of\n\n        entitling them to receive a distribution of evidences of indebtedness or\n\n        stock or other securities or assets (excluding cash dividends payable\n\n        out of consolidated earnings or consolidated earned surplus and\n\n        distributions of the types specified in clauses (1), (2) and (4) of\n\n        subparagraph (A) of this Section 7) or rights or warrants to subscribe\n\n        thereto (excluding those referred to in subparagraph (C) of this Section\n\n        7), the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series\n\n        3 shall thereafter be convertible shall be adjusted by multiplying the\n\n        number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series 3 was\n\n        theretofore convertible by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be\n\n        the current market price per share of Common Stock (as defined in\n\n        subparagraph (D) of this Section 7) at such record date and of which the\n\n        denominator shall be such current market price per share of Common Stock\n\n        less the fair market value (as determined by the Directors, whose\n\n        determination shall be conclusive) of that portion of such evidences of\n\n        indebtedness or stock or other securities or assets so distributed or of\n\n        such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common\n\n        Stock. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such distribution is made\n\n        or such rights or warrants are issued, as the case may be, and upon such\n\n        distribution or issuance shall become effective immediately after the\n\n        record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive\n\n        such distribution or rights or warrants. For purposes of this\n\n        subparagraph (B), consolidated earnings or consolidated earned surplus\n\n        shall be computed by adding thereto all charges against consolidated\n\n        earned surplus on account of dividends paid in shares of Common Stock in\n\n        respect of which an adjustment has been made pursuant to subparagraph\n\n        (A) of this Section 7, all as determined by the independent public\n\n        accountants then regularly auditing the accounts of the Corporation,\n\n        whose determination shall be conclusive.\n\n \n\n             (C) In case the Corporation shall at any time after June 10, 1968\n\n        issue rights or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling them\n\n        (for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for\n\n        determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or\n\n        warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price\n\n        per share less than the current market price per share of Common Stock\n\n        (as defined in subparagraph (D) of this Section 7) at such record date,\n\n        the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series 3\n\n        shall thereafter be convertible shall be determined by multiplying the\n\n        number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series 3 were\n\n        theretofore convertible by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be\n\n        the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance\n\n        of such rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of\n\n        Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase and of which the\n\n        denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on\n\n        the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of\n\n        shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total\n\n        number of shares so offered would purchase at such current market price.\n\n        Such adjustment shall be made whenever such rights or warrants are\n\n        issued and upon such issuance shall\n\n \n\n                                       18\n\n<PAGE>   20\n\n \n\n        become effective immediately after the record date for the determination\n\n        of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants.\n\n \n\n             (D) For the purpose of any computation under subparagraph (B) or\n\n        (C) of this Section 7, the current market price per share of Common\n\n        Stock at any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing\n\n        prices for the thirty consecutive business days commencing forty-five\n\n        business days before the day in question. The closing price for each day\n\n        shall be the last reported sales price regular way on the relevant\n\n        securities exchange or, if there is no reported sale on such day, the\n\n        mean of the reported closing bid and asked quotations on the relevant\n\n        securities exchange on the day, or, with respect to any such day when\n\n        the Common Stock is not listed on any national securities exchange, the\n\n        mean of the closing bid and asked quotations in the over-the-counter\n\n        market on such day as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or\n\n        similar reporting service. For purposes of this subparagraph (D) and\n\n        subparagraph (E) of this Section 7, \"relevant securities exchange\" shall\n\n        mean the New York Stock Exchange unless the Common Stock is not then\n\n        listed thereon, in which event it shall mean the principal national\n\n        securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed or\n\n        admitted to trading as determined by the Corporation, which\n\n        determination shall be conclusive.\n\n \n\n             (E) The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractional\n\n        shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series 3. If more\n\n        than one share of Series 3 shall be surrendered for conversion at one\n\n        time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock\n\n        issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the\n\n        aggregate number of shares so surrendered. If any fractional interest in\n\n        a share of Common Stock would be deliverable upon the conversion of any\n\n        shares of Series 3, the Corporation shall in lieu of delivering the\n\n        fractional share therefor make an adjustment therefor in cash at the\n\n        market value thereof. For such purpose, the market value of a share of\n\n        Common Stock shall be the last reported sale price regular way on the\n\n        relevant securities exchange on the last business day prior to the\n\n        conversion date when the relevant securities exchange is open, or, if\n\n        there is no reported sale on such day, the mean of the reported closing\n\n        bid and asked quotations on the relevant securities exchange on that\n\n        day, or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on any national\n\n        securities exchange, the mean of the closing bid and asked quotations in\n\n        the over-the-counter market on that day as reported by the National\n\n        Quotation Bureau or similar reporting service. This subparagraph (E)\n\n        shall not apply for purposes of making adjustments under subparagraphs\n\n        (A), (B) and (C) of this Section 7.\n\n \n\n             (F) No adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock into\n\n        which each share of Series 3 is convertible shall be required unless\n\n        such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least\n\n        1/1000th of a share in the number of shares of Common Stock into which\n\n        such share is then convertible; provided, however, that any adjustments\n\n        which by reason of this subparagraph (F) are not required to be made\n\n        shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent\n\n        adjustment.\n\n \n\n             (G) Whenever any adjustment is required in the shares into which\n\n        each share of Series 3 is convertible, the Corporation shall forthwith\n\n        keep available at each of its transfer agencies at which Series 3 is\n\n        convertible a statement describing in reasonable detail the adjustment\n\n        and the method of calculation used. The Corporation shall also cause a\n\n        notice, stating that such adjustment has been effected and setting forth\n\n        the adjusted conversion price, to be published at least once in a\n\n        newspaper printed in the English language and customarily published at\n\n        least once a day for at least five days in each calendar week which\n\n        shall be of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of\n\n        New York (herein called an \"Authorized Newspaper\").\n\n \n\n             (H) As evidence of the kind and amount of stock or other\n\n        securities, cash or property into which shares of Series 3 shall be\n\n        convertible, or as to the appropriate adjustments of the conversion rate\n\n        applicable with respect thereto, each transfer agent of Series 3 may\n\n        accept the certificate of any firm of independent public accountants\n\n        (who may be the regular auditors retained by the Corporation) with\n\n        respect thereto, who as to questions of law may request and rely upon an\n\n        opinion of counsel (who may be counsel for the Corporation) and in the\n\n        absence of bad faith upon the part\n\n \n\n                                       19\n\n<PAGE>   21\n\n \n\n        of the transfer agent, it may conclusively rely thereon, and shall not\n\n        be responsible or accountable to any holder of shares of Series 3 for\n\n        any provision in conformity therewith, or approved by such firm of\n\n        independent public accountants.\n\n \n\n          (d) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out\n\n     of the authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock the full number of\n\n     shares of Common Stock into which all shares of Series 3 from time to time\n\n     outstanding are convertible, but shares of Common Stock held in the\n\n     treasury of the Corporation may in its discretion be delivered upon any\n\n     conversion of shares of Series 3.\n\n \n\n          (e) The issue of stock certificates on conversions of shares of Series\n\n     3 shall be without charge to the converting shareholder for any tax in\n\n     respect of the issue thereof. The Corporation shall not, however, be\n\n     required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer\n\n     involved in the issue and delivery of shares in any name other than that of\n\n     the holder of the shares of Series 3 converted, and the Corporation shall\n\n     not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and\n\n     until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to\n\n     the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the\n\n     satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.\n\n \n\n          (f) In case the total amount of cash dividends paid by the Corporation\n\n     in any quarter-annual period on the number of shares of Common Stock into\n\n     which each share of Series 3 shall be convertible at the time of such\n\n     payment exceeds $1.125, it shall cause notice thereof to be published at\n\n     least once in an Authorized Newspaper.\n\n \n\n                                  DIVISION C-4\n\n                          Express Terms of Cumulative\n\n                Redeemable Serial Preference Stock II, Series 4\n\n \n\n     There is hereby established a fourth series of Serial Preference Stock II\n\nto which the following provisions shall be applicable:\n\n \n\n          SECTION 1. Designation of Series.  The series shall be designated\n\n     \"Cumulative Redeemable Serial Preference Stock II, Series 4\" (herein called\n\n     \"Series 4\").\n\n \n\n          SECTION 2. Number of Shares.  The number of shares of Series 4 is\n\n     1,145,000, which number from time to time may be increased or decreased\n\n     (but not below the number of shares of the series then outstanding) by the\n\n     Directors.\n\n \n\n          SECTION 3. Dividends.\n\n \n\n          (a) The holders of record of shares of Series 4 shall be entitled to\n\n     receive, when and as declared by the Directors in accordance with the terms\n\n     hereof, out of funds legally available for the purpose, cumulative\n\n     quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of January, April,\n\n     July and October in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a\n\n     \"Quarterly Dividend Payment Date\"), commencing on the first Quarterly\n\n     Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of any shares of Series 4 or\n\n     any fraction of a share of Series 4, in an amount per share (rounded to the\n\n     nearest cent) equal to the lesser of (i) $100.00 and (ii) subject to the\n\n     provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per\n\n     share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share\n\n     amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions\n\n     (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or a subdivision\n\n     of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, by reclassification or\n\n     otherwise), declared on the shares of Common Stock since the immediately\n\n     preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first\n\n     Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any shares of\n\n     Series 4 or any fraction of a share of Series 4. In the event the\n\n     Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common\n\n     Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or\n\n     combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by\n\n     reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of\n\n     Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock,\n\n     then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series 4\n\n     were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the\n\n     preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a\n\n     fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of\n\n \n\n                                       20\n\n<PAGE>   22\n\n \n\n     Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator\n\n     of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding\n\n     immediately prior to such event.\n\n \n\n          (b) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding\n\n     shares of Series 4 from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding\n\n     the date of issue of such shares of Series 4, unless the date of issue of\n\n     such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend\n\n     Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue\n\n     from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a\n\n     Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the\n\n     determination of holders of shares of Series 4 entitled to receive a\n\n     quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in\n\n     either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be\n\n     cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid\n\n     dividends shall not bear interest. No dividends shall be paid upon or\n\n     declared and set apart for any shares of Series 4 for any dividend period\n\n     unless at the same time a dividend for the same dividend period, ratably in\n\n     proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be\n\n     paid upon or declared and set apart for all Serial Preference Stock II of\n\n     all series then outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend. The\n\n     Directors of the Corporation may fix a record date for the determination of\n\n     holders of shares of Series 4 entitled to receive payment of a dividend or\n\n     distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 40\n\n     days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.\n\n \n\n          SECTION 4. Redemption Rights.  Subject to the provisions of Section\n\n     6(b)(iii) of Division C of Article Fourth hereof and in accordance with the\n\n     provisions of Section 4 of Division C of Article Fourth hereof, the shares\n\n     of Series 4 shall be redeemable from time to time at the option of the\n\n     Directors of the Corporation, as a whole or in part, at any time, at a\n\n     redemption price per share equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase\n\n     Price as defined in that certain rights agreement, dated as of April 24,\n\n     1996 between the Corporation and its rights agent (the \"Rights Agreement\"),\n\n     as the same may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms,\n\n     subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the Rights\n\n     Agreement. Copies of the Rights Agreement are available from the\n\n     Corporation upon request. In the event less than all of the outstanding\n\n     shares of Series 4 are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot\n\n     the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the\n\n     Directors of the Corporation.\n\n \n\n          SECTION 5. Liquidation Rights.\n\n \n\n          (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,\n\n     dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation (hereinafter\n\n     referred to as a \"Liquidation\"), no distribution shall be made to the\n\n     holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon\n\n     Liquidation) to the shares of Series 4, unless, prior thereto, the holders\n\n     of shares of Series 4 shall have received at least an amount per share\n\n     equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase Price as defined in the\n\n     Rights Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time in\n\n     accordance with its terms, subject to adjustment from time to time as\n\n     provided in the Rights Agreement, plus an amount equal to accrued and\n\n     unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not earned or\n\n     declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares\n\n     of Series 4 shall be entitled to receive at least an aggregate amount per\n\n     share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal\n\n     to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of\n\n     shares of Common Stock (the \"Series 4 Liquidation Preference\").\n\n \n\n          (b) In the event, however, that the net assets of the Corporation are\n\n     not sufficient to pay in full the amount of the Series 4 Liquidation\n\n     Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Serial\n\n     Preference Stock II, if any, which rank on a parity with the shares of\n\n     Series 4 as to distribution of assets in Liquidation, all shares of Series\n\n     4 and of such other series of Serial Preference Stock II shall share\n\n     ratably in the distribution of assets (or proceeds thereof) in Liquidation\n\n     in proportion to the full amounts to which they are respectively entitled.\n\n \n\n          (c) In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any\n\n     dividend on the shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock,\n\n     or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding\n\n     shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of\n\n     a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of\n\n     shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders\n\n     of shares of Series 4 were entitled\n\n \n\n                                       21\n\n<PAGE>   23\n\n \n\n     immediately prior to such event pursuant to the proviso set forth in\n\n     paragraph (a) above, shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a\n\n     fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock\n\n     outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is\n\n     the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately\n\n     prior to such event.\n\n \n\n          (d) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any\n\n     other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the\n\n     sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or\n\n     business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation for\n\n     the purposes of this Section 5.\n\n \n\n          SECTION 6. Conversion Right.  The shares of Series 4 shall not be\n\n     convertible into shares of Common Stock.\n\n \n\n                                   DIVISION D\n\n                         Express Terms of Common Stock\n\n \n\n          The Common Stock shall be subject to the express terms of the Serial\n\n     Preference Stock and any series thereof and to the express terms of the\n\n     Serial Preference Stock II and any series thereof. Each share of Common\n\n     Stock shall be equal to every other share of Common Stock; and the holders\n\n     thereof shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock on all\n\n     questions presented to the shareholders.\n\n \n\n          The holders of shares of Common Stock shall have no pre-emptive right\n\n     to purchase or have offered to them for purchase any shares of Common Stock\n\n     or other securities of the Corporation whether now or hereafter authorized.\n\n \n\n     Fifth: The Corporation may from time to time, pursuant to authorization by\n\nits Board of Directors and without action by the shareholders, purchase or\n\notherwise acquire shares of the Corporation of any class; subject, however, to\n\nsuch limitation or restriction, if any, as is contained in the express terms of\n\nany class of shares of the Corporation outstanding at the time of such purchase\n\nor acquisition.\n\n \n\n     Sixth: Any and every statute of Ohio hereafter enacted whereby the rights,\n\npowers or privileges of corporations or of the shareholders of corporations\n\norganized under the laws of Ohio are increased or diminished or in any way\n\naffected, or whereby effect is given to the action taken by any number, less\n\nthan all, of the shareholders of any such corporation, shall apply to the\n\nCorporation and shall be binding not only upon the Corporation but upon every\n\nshareholder of the Corporation to the same extent as if such statute had been in\n\nforce on October 31, 1958, the time of merger of The Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation\n\ninto the Corporation.\n\n \n\n     Seventh: These Amended Articles of Incorporation shall supersede and take\n\nthe place of the heretofore existing Articles of Incorporation of the\n\nCorporation and all amendments thereto.\n\n \n\n                                       22\n\n</TEXT>\n\n", "completion": {"answer": "E", "error": "Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': \"This model's maximum context length is 16385 tokens.
