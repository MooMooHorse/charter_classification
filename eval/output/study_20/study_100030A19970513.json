CONVERSION RIGHT.\n\n\n\n          (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section\n\n     7, shares of Series 1 may, at the option of the holder at any time (or, in\n\n     the case of shares called for redemption, then until and including the\n\n     close of business on the date fixed for redemption but not thereafter if\n\n     payment of the redemption price has been duly provided for by the date\n\n     fixed for redemption), be converted into shares of Common Stock (as such\n\n     shares shall be constituted at the conversion date) at the conversion price\n\n     in effect at the conversion date.\n\n\n\n          (b)  The holder of each share of Series 1 may exercise the conversion\n\n     privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any transfer agent of Series\n\n     1 the share to be converted, accompanied by written notice that the holder\n\n     elects to convert such share.  Conversion shall be deemed to have been\n\n     effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date when such\n\n     delivery is made, and such date is referred to in this Section as the\n\n     \"conversion date\".

For this \n\n          purpose, a stock dividend of more than 15% shall be considered a split\n\n          of the outstanding shares.\n\n\n\n          (f)  In case of any reclassification or change of outstanding shares\n\n     of Common Stock (except a split or combination, or a change in par value,\n\n     or a change from par value to no par value, or a change from no par value\n\n     to par value), or in case of any consolidation or merger to which the\n\n     Corporation is a party (other than a merger in which the Corporation is the\n\n     surviving corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or\n\n     change of the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation except as stated\n\n     above), or in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the\n\n     property of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety,\n\n     lawful provision shall be made as part of the terms of such\n\n     reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance that\n\n     the holder of each share of Series 1 then outstanding shall have the right\n\n     to convert such share into the same kind and amount of stock and other\n\n     securities and property as would be receivable upon such reclassification,\n\n     change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number\n\n     of shares of Common Stock into which such share might have been converted\n\n     immediately prior thereto.\n\n\n\n          As evidence of the kind and amount of stock or other securities or\n\n     property into which shares of Series 1 shall be convertible after any such\n\n     reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, or as\n\n     to the appropriate adjustments of the conversion price applicable with\n\n     respect thereto, the transfer agents may accept the certificate of any firm\n\n     of independent public accountants (who may be the regular auditors retained\n\n     by the Corporation) with respect thereto, who as to questions of law may\n\n     request and rely upon an opinion of counsel (who may be counsel for the\n\n     Corporation) and in the absence of bad faith upon the part of the transfer\n\n     agents, they may conclusively rely thereon, and shall not be responsible or\n\n     accountable to any holder of shares of Series 1 for any provision in\n\n     conformity therewith, or approved by such firm of independent public\n\n     accountants.\n\n\n\n          (g)  The issue of stock certificates on conversions of shares of\n\n     Series 1 shall be without charge to the converting shareholder for any tax\n\n     in respect of the issue thereof.

CONVERSION RIGHT.\n\n\n\n          (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section\n\n     7, shares of Series 3 may, at the option of the holder at any time (or, in\n\n     the case of shares called for redemption, then until and including the\n\n     close of business on the date fixed for redemption but not thereafter if\n\n     payment of the redemption price has been duly provided for by the date\n\n     fixed for redemption), be converted into fully paid and non-assessable\n\n     shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock at\n\n     the rate of 1.862 shares of Common Stock for each share of Series 3.\n\n\n\n          (b)  The holder of each share of Series 3 may exercise the conversion\n\n     privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any transfer agent of Series\n\n     3 the share to be converted accompanied by written notice that the holder\n\n     elects to convert such share.  Conversion shall be deemed to have been\n\n     effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date when such\n\n     delivery is made, and such date is referred to in this Section 7 as the\n\n     \"conversion date\".  On the conversion date or as promptly thereafter as\n\n     practicable the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the holder of shares\n\n     of Series 3 surrendered for conversion, or on his written order, a\n\n     certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the\n\n     conversion of such shares of Series 3 and a check or cash in respect of any\n\n     fraction of a share as provided in subparagraph (E) of this Section 7.  The\n\n     person in whose name the stock certificate is to be issued shall be deemed\n\n     to have become a holder of Common Stock of record on the conversion date.\n\n     No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on such shares of Series 3 or\n\n     for dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued on conversion.\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n          (c)  The number of shares of Common Stock and the number of shares of\n\n     other classes of stock of the Corporation, if any, into which each share of\n\n     Series 3 is convertible shall be subject to adjustment from time to time\n\n     only as follows:\n\n\n\n               (A)  In case the Corporation shall at any time or times after\n\n          June 10, 1968 (1) take a record of the holders of Common Stock for the\n\n          purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend declared payable in\n\n          shares of Common Stock and thereafter pay such dividend, (2) subdivide\n\n          or split the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (3) combine the\n\n          outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or\n\n          (4) issue by reclassification of Common Stock any shares of the\n\n          Corporation, each holder of a share of Series 3 shall thereafter be\n\n          entitled upon the conversion of each share thereof held by him to\n\n          receive for each such share the number of shares of the Corporation\n\n          which he would have owned or have been entitled to receive in respect\n\n          thereof after the happening of the event or events described above\n\n          which shall have happened had such share of Series 3 been converted\n\n          prior to the happening of such event or events, the adjustment to\n\n          become effective immediately at the opening of business on the day\n\n          next following (x) the record date for purposes of clause (1), or (y)\n\n          the day upon which such subdivision, split, combination or\n\n          reclassification shall become effective for purposes of clauses (2),\n\n          (3) and (4).\n\n\n\n               (B)  In case the Corporation shall at any time or times after\n\n          June 10, 1968 take a record of the holders of Common Stock for the\n\n          purpose of entitling them to receive a distribution of evidences of\n\n          indebtedness or stock or other securities or assets (excluding cash\n\n          dividends payable out of consolidated earnings or consolidated earned\n\n          surplus and distributions of the types specified in clauses (1), (2)\n\n          and (4) of subparagraph (A) of this Section 7) or rights or warrants\n\n          to subscribe thereto (excluding those referred to in subparagraph (C)\n\n          of this Section 7), the number of shares of Common Stock into which\n\n          each share of Series 3 shall thereafter be convertible shall be\n\n          adjusted by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock into\n\n          which such share of Series 3 was theretofore convertible by a\n\n          fraction, of which the numerator shall be the current market price per\n\n          share of Common Stock (as defined in subparagraph (D) of this Section\n\n          7) at such record date and of which the denominator shall be such\n\n          current market price per share of Common Stock less the fair market\n\n          value (as determined by the Directors, whose determination shall be\n\n          conclusive) of that portion of such evidences of indebtedness or stock\n\n          or other securities or assets so distributed or of such subscription\n\n          rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock.  Such\n\n          adjustment shall be made whenever such distribution is made or such\n\n          rights or warrants are issued, as the case may be, and upon such\n\n          distribution or issuance shall become effective immediately after the\n\n          record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive\n\n          such distribution or rights or warrants.  For purposes of this\n\n          subparagraph (B), consolidated earnings or consolidated earned surplus\n\n          shall be computed by adding thereto all charges against consolidated\n\n          earned surplus on account of dividends paid in shares of Common Stock\n\n          in respect of which an adjustment has been made pursuant to\n\n          subparagraph (A) of this Section 7, all as determined by the\n\n          independent public accountants then regularly auditing the accounts of\n\n          the Corporation, whose determination shall be conclusive.\n\n\n\n               (C)  In case the Corporation shall at any time after June 10,\n\n          1968 issue rights or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling\n\n          them (for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for\n\n          determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or\n\n          warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a\n\n          price per share less than the current market price per share of Common\n\n          Stock (as defined in subparagraph (D) of this Section 7) at such\n\n          record date, the number of shares of Common Stock into which each\n\n          share of Series 3 shall thereafter be convertible shall be determined\n\n          by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock into which such\n\n          shares of Series 3 were theretofore convertible by a fraction, of\n\n          which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock\n\n          outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus\n\n          the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for\n\n          subscription or purchase and of which the denominator shall be the\n\n          number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance\n\n          of such rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock\n\n          which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so\n\n          offered would purchase at such current market price.

The closing\n\n          price for each day shall be the last reported sales price regular way\n\n          on the relevant securities exchange or, if there is no reported sale\n\n          on such day, the mean of the reported closing bid and asked quotations\n\n          on the relevant securities exchange on the day, or, with respect to\n\n          any such day when the Common Stock is not listed on any national\n\n          securities exchange, the mean of the closing bid and asked quotations\n\n          in the over-the-counter market on such day as reported by the National\n\n          Quotation Bureau or similar reporting service.  For purposes of this\n\n          subparagraph (D) and subparagraph (E) of this Section 7, \"relevant\n\n          securities exchange\" shall mean the New York Stock Exchange unless the\n\n          Common Stock is not then listed thereon, in which event it shall mean\n\n          the principal national securities exchange on which the shares of\n\n          Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading as determined by the\n\n          Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive.\n\n\n\n               (E)  The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractional\n\n          shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series 3.  If more\n\n          than one share of Series 3 shall be surrendered for conversion at one\n\n          time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock\n\n          issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the\n\n          aggregate number of shares so surrendered.  If any fractional interest\n\n          in a share of Common Stock would be deliverable upon the conversion of\n\n          any shares of Series 3, the Corporation shall in lieu of delivering\n\n          the fractional share therefor make an adjustment therefor in cash at\n\n          the market value thereof.  For such purpose, the market value of a\n\n          share of Common Stock shall be the last reported sale price regular\n\n          way on the relevant securities exchange on the last business day prior\n\n          to the conversion date when the relevant securities exchange is open,\n\n          or, if there is no reported sale on such day, the mean of the reported\n\n          closing bid and asked quotations on the relevant securities exchange\n\n          on that day, or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on any\n\n          national securities exchange, the mean of the closing bid and asked\n\n          quotations in the over-the-counter market on that day as reported by\n\n          the National Quotation Bureau or similar reporting service.  This\n\n          subparagraph (E) shall not apply for purposes of making adjustments\n\n          under subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) of this Section 7.\n\n\n\n               (F)  No adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock into\n\n          which each share of Series 3 is convertible shall be required unless\n\n          such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least\n\n          1/1000th of a share in the number of shares of Common Stock into which\n\n          such share is then convertible; provided, however, that any\n\n          adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph (F) are not required\n\n          to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any\n\n          subsequent adjustment.\n\n\n\n               (G)  Whenever any adjustment is required in the shares into which\n\n          each share of Series 3 is convertible, the Corporation shall forthwith\n\n          keep available at each of its transfer agencies at which Series 3 is\n\n          convertible a statement describing in reasonable detail the adjustment\n\n          and the method of calculation used.  The Corporation shall also cause\n\n          a notice, stating that such adjustment has been effected and setting\n\n          forth the adjusted conversion price, to be published at least once in\n\n          a newspaper printed in the English language and customarily published\n\n          at least once a day for at least five days in each calendar week which\n\n          shall be of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, the City\n\n          of New York (herein called an \"Authorized Newspaper\").\n\n\n\n               (H)  As evidence of the kind and amount of stock or other\n\n          securities, cash or property into which shares of Series 3 shall be\n\n          convertible, or as to the appropriate adjustments of the conversion\n\n          rate applicable with respect thereto, each transfer agent of Series 3\n\n          may accept the certificate of any firm of independent public\n\n          accountants (who may be the regular auditors retained by the\n\n          Corporation) with respect thereto, who as to questions of law may\n\n          request and rely upon an opinion of counsel (who may be counsel for\n\n          the Corporation) and in the absence of bad faith upon the part\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n          of the transfer agent, it may conclusively rely thereon, and shall not\n\n          be responsible or accountable to any holder of shares of Series 3 for\n\n          any provision in conformity therewith, or approved by such firm of\n\n          independent public accountants.\n\n\n\n          (d)  The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out\n\n     of the authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock the full number of\n\n     shares of Common Stock into which all shares of Series 3 from time to time\n\n     outstanding are convertible, but shares of Common Stock held in the\n\n     treasury of the Corporation may in its discretion be delivered upon any\n\n     conversion of shares of Series 3.\n\n\n\n          (e)  The issue of stock certificates on conversions of shares of\n\n     Series 3 shall be without charge to the converting shareholder for any tax\n\n     in respect of the issue thereof.

No dividends shall be paid upon or\n\n     declared and set apart for any shares of Series 4 for any dividend period\n\n     unless at the same time a dividend for the same dividend period, ratably in\n\n     proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be\n\n     paid upon or declared and set apart for all Serial Preference Stock II of\n\n     all series then outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend.  The\n\n     Directors of the Corporation may fix a record date for the determination of\n\n     holders of shares of Series 4 entitled to receive payment of a dividend or\n\n     distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 40\n\n     days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.\n\n\n\n          SECTION 4.  REDEMPTION RIGHTS.  Subject to the provisions of Section\n\n     6(b)(iii) of Division C of Article Fourth hereof and in accordance with the\n\n     provisions of Section 4 of Division C of Article Fourth hereof, the shares\n\n     of Series 4 shall be redeemable from time to time at the option of the\n\n     Directors of the Corporation, as a whole or in part, at any time, at a\n\n     redemption price per share equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase\n\n     Price as defined in that certain rights agreement, dated as of April 24,\n\n     1996 between the Corporation and its rights agent (the \"Rights Agreement\"),\n\n     as the same may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms,\n\n     subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the Rights\n\n     Agreement.  Copies of the Rights Agreement are available from the\n\n     Corporation upon request.  In the event less than all of the outstanding\n\n     shares of Series 4 are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select by lot\n\n     the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the\n\n     Directors of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n          SECTION 5.  LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.\n\n\n\n          (a)  In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,\n\n     dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation (hereinafter\n\n     referred to as a \"Liquidation\"), no distribution shall be made to the\n\n     holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon\n\n     Liquidation) to the shares of Series 4, unless, prior thereto, the holders\n\n     of shares of Series 4 shall have received at least an amount per share\n\n     equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase Price as defined in the\n\n     Rights Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time in\n\n     accordance with its terms, subject to adjustment from time to time as\n\n     provided in the Rights Agreement, plus an amount equal to accrued and\n\n     unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not earned or\n\n     declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares\n\n     of Series 4 shall be entitled to receive at least an aggregate amount per\n\n     share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal\n\n     to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of\n\n     shares of Common Stock (the \"Series 4 Liquidation Preference\").\n\n\n\n          (b)  In the event, however, that the net assets of the Corporation are\n\n     not sufficient to pay in full the amount of the Series 4 Liquidation\n\n     Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Serial\n\n     Preference Stock II, if any, which rank on a parity with the shares of\n\n     Series 4 as to distribution of assets in Liquidation, all shares of Series\n\n     4 and of such other series of Serial Preference Stock II shall share\n\n     ratably in the distribution of assets (or proceeds thereof) in Liquidation\n\n     in proportion to the full amounts to which they are respectively entitled.\n\n\n\n          (c)  In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any\n\n     dividend on the shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock,\n\n     or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding\n\n     shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of\n\n     a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of\n\n     shares of Common\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n     Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of\n\n     Series 4 were entitled immediately prior to such event pursuant to the\n\n     proviso set forth in paragraph (a) above, shall be adjusted by multiplying\n\n     such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares\n\n     of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the\n\n     denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were\n\n     outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n          (d)  The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any\n\n     other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the\n\n     sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or\n\n     business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation for\n\n     the purposes of this Section 5.\n\n\n\n          SECTION 6.  CONVERSION RIGHT.  The shares of Series 4 shall not be\n\n     convertible into shares of Common Stock.\n\n\n\n                                   DIVISION  D\n\n                          EXPRESS TERMS OF COMMON STOCK\n\n\n\n          The Common Stock shall be subject to the express terms of the Serial\n\n     Preference Stock and any series thereof and to the express terms of the\n\n     Serial Preference Stock II and any series thereof.  Each share of Common\n\n     Stock shall be equal to every other share of Common Stock; and the holders\n\n     thereof shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock on all\n\n     questions presented to the shareholders.\n\n\n\n          The holders of shares of Common Stock shall have no pre-emptive right\n\n     to purchase or have offered to them for purchase any shares of Common Stock\n\n     or other securities of the Corporation whether now or hereafter authorized.\n\n\n\n     Fifth:  The Corporation may from time to time, pursuant to authorization by\n\nits Board of Directors and without action by the shareholders, purchase or\n\notherwise acquire shares of the Corporation of any class; subject, however, to\n\nsuch limitation or restriction, if any, as is contained in the express terms of\n\nany class of shares of the Corporation outstanding at the time of such purchase\n\nor acquisition.\n\n\n\n     Sixth:  Any and every statute of Ohio hereafter enacted whereby the rights,\n\npowers or privileges of corporations or of the shareholders of corporations\n\norganized under the laws of Ohio are increased or diminished or in any way\n\naffected, or whereby effect is given to the action taken by any number, less\n\nthan all, of the shareholders of any such corporation, shall apply to the\n\nCorporation and shall be binding not only upon the Corporation but upon every\n\nshareholder of the Corporation to the same extent as if such statute had been in\n\nforce on October 31, 1958, the time of merger of The Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation\n\ninto the Corporation.\n\n\n\n     Seventh:  These Amended Articles of Incorporation shall supersede and take\n\nthe place of the heretofore existing Articles of Incorporation of the\n\nCorporation and all amendments thereto.\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\n\n\n</TEXT>\n\n", "completion": {"answer": "E", "error": "Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': \"This model's maximum context length is 16385 tokens.
