Shares so issued, shall be full paid\n\n     stock, and the holders of such stock shall not be liable to any further\n\n     call or assessments thereon.\n\n\n\n     3.2  ABANDONMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Anything herein contained\n\n     to the contrary notwithstanding, any and all right, title, interest, and\n\n     claim in or to any dividends declared, or other distributions made, by the\n\n     corporation, whether in cash, stock or otherwise, which are unclaimed by\n\n     the stockholder entitled thereto for a period of six years after the close\n\n     of business on the payment date, shall be and be deemed to be extinguished\n\n     and abandoned; and such unclaimed dividends or other distributions in the\n\n     possession of the corporation, its transfer agents or other agents or\n\n     depositaries, shall at such time become the absolute property of the\n\n     corporation, free and clear of any and all claims of any persons\n\n     whatsoever.\n\n\n\n     FIFTH.

The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or\n\nunder the direction of a board of directors consisting of not less than three\n\nnor more than eighteen directors.  The exact number shall be determined from\n\ntime to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the\n\ndirectors in office at the time of adoption of such resolution.\n\n\n\n          The directors shall be divided into three classes, each class\n\nconsisting, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of\n\ndirectors constituting the entire board of directors.  At each annual meeting of\n\nstockholders, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that\n\nannual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term.  If the number of\n\ndirectors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the\n\nclasses by the board of directors so as to maintain the number of directors in\n\neach class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class\n\nelected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold\n\noffice for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class.  In\n\nno case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any\n\nincumbent director even though such decrease may result in an inequality of the\n\nclasses until the expiration of such term.\n\n\n\n                                      63\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nA director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which\n\nhis term expires and until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify,\n\nsubject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement or removal from\n\noffice.  No director may be removed except for cause.  Any vacancy on the\n\nboard of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors\n\nmay be filled by a majority of the board of directors then in office, and any\n\nother vacancy occurring on the board of directors may be filled by a majority\n\nof the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole\n\nremaining director.  Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from\n\nan increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as\n\nthat of his predecessor.\n\n\n\n          Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more\n\nclasses or series of preferred stock issued by the corporation shall have the\n\nright, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or\n\nspecial meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of\n\nvacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the\n\nterms of this certificate of incorporation applicable thereto, and such\n\ndirectors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this article\n\nsixth unless expressly provided by such terms.\n\n\n\n     SEVENTH.  Each person who is or was a director or officer of the\n\ncorporation, and each person who serves or served at the request of the\n\ncorporation as a director or officer (or equivalent) of another enterprise,\n\nshall be indemnified by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the\n\nGeneral Corporation Law of Delaware as it may be in effect from time to time,\n\nexcept as to any action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of a\n\ndirector or officer without prior approval of the board of directors.\n\n\n\n     EIGHTH.  No stockholder action required to be taken or which may be taken\n\nat any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation may be taken\n\nwithout a meeting, and the power of stockholders to consent in writing without a\n\nmeeting to the taking of any action is specifically denied.\n\n\n\n     NINTH.  No director shall be personally liable to the corporation or its\n\nstockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty by such\n\ndirector as a director.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, a director\n\nshall be liable to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for breach of the\n\ndirector's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts\n\nor omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a\n\nknowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General\n\nCorporation Law or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an\n\nimproper personal benefit.  No amendment to or repeal of this Article NINTH\n\nshall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any\n\ndirector of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such\n\ndirector occurring prior to such amendment.\n\n\n\n                                      64\n\n</TEXT>\n\n", "completion": {"answer": "Y", "reference": ["NINTH.
