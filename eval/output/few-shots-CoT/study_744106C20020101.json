The\n\nCorporation may, in connection with preparing a list of stockholders entitled to\n\nvote at any meeting of stockholders, or as a condition to the transfer or the\n\nregistration of shares of Class B Stock on the Corporation's books, require the\n\nfurnishing of such affidavits or other proof as it deems necessary to establish\n\nthat any person is the beneficial owner of shares of Class B Stock or is a\n\nPermitted Transferee.\n\n\n\n     (e) At any time when the number of outstanding shares of Class B Stock as\n\nreflected on the stock transfer books of the Corporation falls below 2.5% of the\n\naggregate number of the issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock and\n\nClass B Stock of the Corporation, or the Board of Directors and the holders of a\n\nmajority of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock approve the conversion of\n\nall of the Class B Stock into Common Stock, then, immediately upon the\n\noccurrence of either such event, the outstanding shares of Class B Stock shall\n\nbe converted into shares of Common Stock. In the event of such a conversion,\n\ncertificates formerly representing outstanding shares of Class B Stock shall\n\nthereupon and thereafter be deemed to represent the like number of shares of\n\nCommon Stock.\n\n\n\n     (f) Shares of Class B Stock shall be registered in the names of the\n\nbeneficial owners thereof and not in \"street\" or \"nominee\" name. For this\n\npurpose, a \"beneficial owner\" of any shares of Class B Stock shall mean a person\n\nwho, or an entity which, possesses the power, either singly or jointly, to\n\ndirect the voting or disposition of such shares. The Corporation shall note on\n\nthe certificates for shares of Class B Stock the restrictions on transfer and\n\nregistration of transfer imposed by this Section III.\n\n\n\n  IV.  CONVERSION RIGHTS.\n\n\n\n     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section IV, each share of\n\nClass B Stock shall be convertible at any time or from time to time, at the\n\noption of the respective holder thereof, at the office of any transfer agent for\n\nClass B Stock, and at such other place or places, if any, as the Board of\n\nDirectors may designate, or, if the Board of Directors shall fail so to\n\ndesignate, at the principal office of the Corporation (attention of the\n\nSecretary of the Corporation), into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share\n\nof Common Stock. Upon conversion, the Corporation shall make no payment or\n\nadjustment on account of dividends accrued or in arrears on Class B Stock\n\nsurrendered for conversion or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock\n\nissuable on such conversion. Before any holder of Class B Stock shall be\n\nentitled to convert the same into Common Stock, he shall surrender the\n\ncertificate or certificates for such Class B Stock at the office of said\n\ntransfer agent (or other place as provided above), which certificate or\n\ncertificates, if the Corporation shall so request, shall be duly endorsed to the\n\nCorporation or in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer to the\n\nCorporation or in blank (such endorsements or instruments of transfer to be in\n\nform satisfactory to the Corporation), and shall give written notice to the\n\nCorporation at said office that he elects so to convert said Class B Stock in\n\naccordance with the terms of this Section IV, and shall state in\n\n\n\n                                       A-14\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nwriting therein the name or names in which he wishes the certificate or\n\ncertificates for Common Stock to be issued. Every such notice of election to\n\nconvert shall constitute a contract between the holder of such Class B Stock and\n\nthe Corporation, whereby the holder of such Class B Stock shall be deemed to\n\nsubscribe for the amount of Common Stock which he shall be entitled to receive\n\nupon such conversion, and, in satisfaction of such subscription, to deposit the\n\nClass B Stock to be converted and to release the Corporation from all liability\n\nthereunder, and thereby the Corporation shall be deemed to agree that the\n\nsurrender of the certificate or certificates therefor and the extinguishment of\n\nliability thereon shall constitute full payment of such subscription for Common\n\nStock to be issued upon such conversion. The Corporation will as soon as\n\npracticable after such deposit of a certificate or certificates for Class B\n\nStock, accompanied by the written notice and the statement above prescribed,\n\nissue and deliver at the office of said transfer agent (or other place as\n\nprovided above) to the person for whose account such Class B Stock was so\n\nsurrendered, or to his nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for\n\nthe number of full shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as\n\naforesaid. Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section IV, such\n\nconversion shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of such surrender of\n\nthe Class B Stock to be converted; and the person or persons entitled to receive\n\nthe Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Class B Stock shall be treated\n\nfor all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Common Stock on such\n\ndate.\n\n\n\n     (b) The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon conversion\n\nof shares of Class B Stock shall be made without charge for any stamp or other\n\nsimilar tax in respect of such issuance. However, if any such certificate is to\n\nbe issued in a name other than that of the holder of the share or shares of\n\nClass B Stock converted, the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof\n\nshall pay to the Corporation the amount of any tax which may be payable in\n\nrespect of any transfer involved in such issuance or shall establish to the\n\nsatisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.\n\n\n\n     (c) The Corporation shall not be required to convert Class B Stock, and no\n\nsurrender of Class B Stock shall be effective for that purpose, while the stock\n\ntransfer books of the Corporation are closed for any purpose; but the surrender\n\nof Class B Stock for conversion during any period while such books are so closed\n\nshall become effective for conversion immediately upon the reopening of such\n\nbooks, as if the conversion had been made on the date such Class B Stock was\n\nsurrendered.\n\n\n\n     (d) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep\n\navailable, solely for the purpose of issue upon conversion of the outstanding\n\nshares of Class B Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be\n\nissuable upon the conversion of all such outstanding shares, provided that\n\nnothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude the Corporation from\n\nsatisfying its obligations in respect of the conversion of the outstanding\n\nshares of Class B Stock by delivery of shares of Common Stock which are held in\n\nthe treasury of the Corporation. The Corporation covenants that if any shares of\n\nCommon Stock required to be reserved for purposes of conversion hereunder\n\nrequire registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any\n\nfederal or state law before such shares of Common Stock may be issued upon\n\nconversion, the Corporation will use its best efforts to cause such shares to be\n\nduly registered or approved, as the case may be. The Corporation will endeavor\n\nto list the shares of Common Stock required to be delivered upon conversion\n\nprior to such delivery upon each national securities exchange, if any, upon\n\nwhich the outstanding Common Stock is listed at the time of such delivery. The\n\nCorporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock which shall be issued upon\n\nconversion of the shares of Class B Stock, will, upon issue, be fully paid and\n\nnonassessable and not entitled to any pre-emptive rights.\n\n\n\n  V.
