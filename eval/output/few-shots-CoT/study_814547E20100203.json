Following the payment of\n\nthe full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional\n\ndistributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Participating\n\nPreferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock\n\nshall have received an amount per share (the \u0093Common Adjustment\u0094) equal to the\n\nquotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii)\n\n1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to\n\nreflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalization with\n\nrespect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the \u0093Adjustment\n\nNumber\u0094).

In the event, following payment in\n\nfull of all liquidation preferences of all shares senior to Common Stock\n\n(including the Series A Participating Preferred Stock), there are not\n\nsufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common\n\nAdjustment, then the remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the\n\nholders of Common Stock.\n\n\n\n(C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights\n\nDeclaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of\n\nCommon Stock,\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n#####  \n\n\n\n(ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding\n\nCommon Stock into a smaller number of shares, by reclassification or\n\notherwise, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately\n\nprior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by\n\na fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock\n\noutstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to\n\nsuch event.\n\n\n\n7\\. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any\n\nconsolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of\n\nCommon Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash\n\nor any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A\n\nParticipating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or\n\nchanged in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment\n\nhereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock,\n\nsecurities, cash or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be,\n\ninto which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In\n\nthe event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date\n\n(i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock,\n\n(ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding\n\nCommon Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the\n\namount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or\n\nchange of shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted\n\nby multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number\n\nof shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the\n\ndenominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that are\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n8\\. Redemption. The shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock shall not\n\nbe redeemable.\n\n\n\n9\\. Ranking. The Series A Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to\n\nall other series of the Corporation\u0092s Preferred Stock as to the payment of\n\ndividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series\n\nshall provide otherwise.\n\n\n\n10\\. Amendment. The Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the\n\nCorporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially\n\nalter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A\n\nParticipating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the\n\naffirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares\n\nof Series A Participating Preferred Stock voting separately as a class.\n\n\n\n11\\.

Series A Participating Preferred Stock may be issued\n\nin fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such\n\nholder\u0092s fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends,\n\nparticipate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of\n\nholders of Series A Participating Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n", "completion": {"answer": "Y", "reference": ["(a) A director of the corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director\u2019s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit."], "reason": "The charter explicitly states that a director of the corporation shall not be liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except under specific circumstances.
