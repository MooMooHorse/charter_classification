It is the declared collective conclusion of the Corporation and\n\nits shareholders that such policy will not adequately be furthered if any\n\nperson after acquiring such control may, in its discretion, determine whether\n\nor not to acquire the remaining equity interests in the Corporation. Even if\n\nthese Articles of Incorporation were to require such person to pay to the\n\nholders of such remaining equity interests a price deemed fair and equitable\n\nunder the circumstances in the event such person determines to acquire such\n\nremaining equity interests, such person would not otherwise be required to\n\neffect any such acquisition. Therefore, to carry out the aforementioned intent\n\nand policy, the Corporation and its shareholders hereby approve and adopt this\n\nArticle 14.\n\n\n\nB.

The number of votes which may be cast by\n\nany record owner by virtue of the provisions of this Article 14 in respect of\n\nVoting Shares of any class or series beneficially owned by a Substantial\n\nShareholder shall be a number equal to the total number of votes which a\n\nsingle record owner of all Voting Shares of such class or series beneficially\n\nowned by such Substantial Shareholder would be entitled to cast, multiplied by\n\na fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of such class or\n\nseries beneficially owned by such Substantial Shareholder and owned of record\n\nby such record owner and the denominator of which is the total number of\n\nshares of such class or series beneficially owned by such Substantial\n\nShareholder.\n\n\n\nC.

If the provisions of the preceding sentence\n\nshall have the effect of reducing the total number of votes which any\n\nSubstantial Shareholder and the record owner(s) of Voting Shares of any class\n\nor series beneficially owned by such Substantial Shareholder shall be entitled\n\nto cast, such reduction shall be effected, and the number of votes which such\n\nrecord owner(s) shall be entitled to cast (by reason of this paragraph C.\n\nshall be determined, in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of\n\nparagraph B. of this Article 14).\n\n\n\nD.
