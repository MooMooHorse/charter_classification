INC.\n\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n\n\n     The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or \n\nactivity for which a corporation may be organized under the General \n\nCorporation Law of California other than the banking business, the trust \n\ncompany business or the practice of a profession permitted to be incorporated \n\nby the California Corporation Code.\n\n\n\n                                         III.\n\n\n\n     (a)     This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of shares \n\ndesignated \"Preferred Stock\" and \"Common Stock\", respectively.  The total \n\nnumber of shares which this corporation shall have authority to issue is Two \n\nHundred Thirty Five Million (235,000,000), par value of $0.00067 per share.  \n\nThe number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized to be issued is Ten \n\nMillion (10,000,000), and the number of shares of Common Stock authorized to \n\nbe issued is Two Hundred Twenty Five Million (225,000,000).  Upon the \n\neffective date of the filing of these Amended and Restated Articles of \n\nIncorporation, each two (2) shares of the corporation's outstanding Common \n\nStock shall be converted and reconstituted into three (3) shares of Common \n\nStock (the \"Stock Split\").\n\n\n\n     No fractional shares shall be issued as a result of the Stock Split.  \n\nEach holder entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Common Stock as a \n\nresult of the Stock Split, when all shares of \n\n\n\n                                      1\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nCommon Stock held by such holder are aggregated together, shall, in lieu of a \n\nfractional share, receive cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of \n\nthe Company's Common Stock on the date of the filing of these Amended and \n\nRestated Articles of Incorporation, as determined by the corporation's Board \n\nof Directors, multiplied by the fraction of a share of Common Stock to which \n\nsuch holder would otherwise be entitled.\n\n\n\n     (b) The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more \n\nseries. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized, within the limitations \n\nand restrictions stated in these Articles of Incorporation to determine or \n\nalter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or \n\nimposed upon any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock and the number of \n\nshares constituting any such series and the designation thereof, or any of \n\nthem; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series \n\nsubsequent to the issue of shares of that series, but not below the number of \n\nshares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any \n\nseries shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall \n\nresume the status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution \n\noriginally fixing the number of shares of such series.\n\n\n\n                                         IV.\n\n\n\n     Shareholders shall not be entitled to cumulate their votes for the \n\nelection of directors of the corporation.\n\n\n\n     This Article IV shall become effective only when the corporation \n\nbecomes, and only for so long as the corporation remains, a listed \n\ncorporation within the meaning of Section 301.5 of the California \n\nCorporations Code.\n\n\n\n                                          V.\n\n\n\n     No action shall be taken by the shareholders of the corporation other \n\nthan at an annual or special meeting of the shareholders, upon due notice and \n\nin accordance with the provisions of the corporation's bylaws.\n\n\n\n                                         VI.\n\n\n\n     (a) On or prior to the date on which the corporation first provides \n\nnotice of an annual meeting of the shareholders following the date this \n\nArticle VI shall have become effective (and provided that the authorized \n\nnumber of directors of the corporation shall be not less than six), the Board \n\nof Directors of the corporation shall divide the directors into two classes, \n\nas nearly equal in number as reasonably possible with the term of office of \n\nthe first class to expire at the 1997 annual meeting of shareholders or any \n\nspecial meeting in lieu thereof and the term of office of the second class to \n\nexpire at the 1998 annual meeting of shareholders or any special meeting in \n\nlieu thereof.  At each annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting in \n\nlieu thereof following such initial classification, directors elected to \n\nsucceed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of \n\noffice to expire at the second succeeding annual meeting of shareholders or \n\nspecial meeting in lieu thereof after their election and until their \n\nsuccessors are duly elected and qualified.\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n     (b) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred \n\nStock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any \n\nincrease in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board \n\nof Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, \n\nremoval from office or other cause may be filled only by a majority vote of \n\nthe directors then in office even though less than a quorum, or by a sole \n\nremaining director. In the event of any increase or decrease in the \n\nauthorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall \n\nnevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he or she is a \n\nmember until the expiration of his or her current term or his or her prior \n\ndeath, retirement, removal or resignation and (ii) the newly created or \n\neliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall, if \n\nreasonably possible, be apportioned by the Board of Directors between the two \n\nclasses of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than one \n\ndirector more than any other class.  To the extent reasonably possible, \n\nconsistent with the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships shall be \n\nadded to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest \n\ndates following such allocation and newly eliminated directorships shall be \n\nsubtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the \n\nearliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided for from \n\ntime to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in \n\noffice, although less than a quorum.  In the event of a vacancy in the Board \n\nof Directors, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law, \n\nmay exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is \n\nfilled.\n\n\n\n     (c)  This Article VI shall become effective only when the corporation \n\nbecomes, and only for so long as the corporation remains, a listed \n\ncorporation within the meaning of Section 301.5 of the California \n\nCorporations Code.\n\n\n\n                                      VII.\n\n\n\n     Section 1.    LIMITATION OF DIRECTORS' LIABILITY.  The liability of the \n\ndirectors of the corporation for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the \n\nfullest extent permissible under California law.\n\n\n\n     Section 2.    INDEMNIFICATION OF CORPORATE AGENTS.  This corporation is \n\nauthorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in Section 317 of \n\nthe California Corporations Code) through bylaw provisions, agreements with \n\nagents, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors  or otherwise, in \n\nexcess of the indemnification otherwise permitted by such Section 317 of the \n\nCalifornia Corporations Code, subject only to the applicable limits set forth \n\nin Section 204 of the California Corporations Code with respect to  actions \n\nfor breach of duty to the corporation and its shareholders.\n\n\n\n     Section 3.    REPEAL OR MODIFICATION.  Any repeal or modification of the \n\nforegoing provisions of this Article VII  shall not adversely affect any \n\nright or protection of a director of the corporation existing at the time of \n\nsuch repeal or modification.\n\n\n\n     3.  The foregoing amendment and restatement of these Articles of \n\nIncorporation has been duly approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n     4.  In accordance with Sections 902(c) and 903(a)(2) of the California \n\nGeneral Corporation Law, the foregoing amendment may be adopted with approval \n\nby the Board of Directors alone and does not require approval by the \n\noutstanding shares.\n\n\n\n     We further declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State \n\nof California that the matters set forth in the foregoing certificate are \n\ntrue of our own knowledge.
