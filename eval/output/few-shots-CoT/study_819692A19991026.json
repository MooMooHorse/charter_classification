With respect to each vote in excess\n\n         of twenty percent (20%) of the voting power of the outstanding shares\n\n         of Voting Stock of the Corporation which such record holders would\n\n         otherwise be entitled to cast without giving effect to this Article\n\n         SIXTH, the record holders in the aggregate shall be entitled to cast\n\n         only one hundredth (1/100) of a vote and the aggregate voting power of\n\n         such record holders, so limited, for all shares of Voting Stock of the\n\n         Corporation Beneficially Owned by the Related Person shall be\n\n         allocated proportionately among such record holders.  For each such\n\n         record holder, this allocation shall be accomplished by multiplying\n\n         the aggregate voting power, as so limited, of the outstanding shares\n\n         of Voting Stock of the Corporation Beneficially Owned by the Related\n\n         Person by a fraction whose numerator is the number of votes\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\n<PAGE>   7\n\n         represented by the shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation owned of\n\n         record by such record holder (and which are Beneficially Owned by the\n\n         Related Person) and whose denominator is the total number of votes\n\n         represented by the shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation\n\n         Beneficially Owned by the Related Person.  A Person who is a record\n\n         owner of shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation that are\n\n         Beneficially Owned simultaneously by more than one person shall have,\n\n         with respect to such shares, the right to cast the least number of\n\n         votes that such Person would be entitled to cast under this Article\n\n         SIXTH by virtue of such shares being so Beneficially Owned by any of\n\n         such Persons.\n\n\n\n                 B.

The restriction contained in\n\n         this Article SIXTH shall not apply to (i) any underwriter or member of\n\n         an underwriting or selling group involving a public sale or resale of\n\n         securities of the Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof; provided,\n\n         however, that upon completion of the sale or resale of such\n\n         securities, no such underwriter or member of such selling group is a\n\n         Related Person, or (ii) any proxy granted to one or more Continuing\n\n         Directors by a stockholder of the Corporation.  In addition, the\n\n         Continuing Directors of the Corporation, the officers and employees of\n\n         the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the directors of Subsidiaries of\n\n         the Corporation, the employee benefit plans of the Corporation and its\n\n         Subsidiaries, entities organized or established by the Corporation or\n\n         any Subsidiary thereof pursuant to the terms of such plans and\n\n         trustees and fiduciaries with respect to such plans acting in such\n\n         capacity shall not be deemed to be a group with respect to their\n\n         Beneficial Ownership of Voting Stock of the Corporation solely by\n\n         virtue of their being directors, officers or employees of the\n\n         Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof or by virtue of the Continuing\n\n         Directors of the Corporation, the officers and employees of the\n\n         Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the directors of Subsidiaries of\n\n         the Corporation being fiduciaries or beneficiaries of an employee\n\n         benefit plan of the Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Corporation.\n\n         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no director, officer or employee of the\n\n         Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or group of any of them shall\n\n         be exempt from the provisions of this Article SIXTH should any such\n\n         Person or group become a Related Person.\n\n\n\n                 C.       Determinations by the Continuing Directors.  A\n\n         majority of the Continuing Directors shall have the power to make all\n\n         determinations, which shall be conclusive and binding, with respect to\n\n         this Article SIXTH, including, without limitation, (i) the amount of\n\n         securities Beneficially Owned by any Person, (ii) whether a Person is\n\n         an Affiliate or Associate of another, (iii) whether a Person has an\n\n         agreement, arrangement or understanding with another as to the matters\n\n         referred to in the definition of Beneficial Ownership, (iv) the\n\n         application of any other definition or operative\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\n<PAGE>   8\n\n         provisions of this Article SIXTH to the given facts, or (v) any other\n\n         matter relating to the applicability or effect of this Article SIXTH.\n\n         The Corporation may, by bylaw or by resolution approved by the\n\n         affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors, adopt such\n\n         provisions or resolutions as are necessary to provide for the\n\n         enforcement of this Article SIXTH which shall be final and conclusive.\n\n         Any construction, application, or determination made by the Continuing\n\n         Directors in good faith pursuant to this Article SIXTH shall be\n\n         conclusive and binding upon the Corporation and its stockholders,\n\n         including any Related Person.  Nothing contained in this Article SIXTH\n\n         shall be construed to relieve any Related Person from any fiduciary\n\n         obligation imposed by law.\n\n\n\n                 D.       Right of Continuing Directors to Demand Certain\n\n         Information From Related Person.  A majority of the Continuing\n\n         Directors shall have the right to demand that any Person who after\n\n         reasonable inquiry is believed to be a Related Person or a holder of\n\n         record of shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation or securities\n\n         convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Voting Stock of\n\n         the Corporation which is believed to be Beneficially Owned by a\n\n         Related Person, furnish the Corporation with accurate and complete\n\n         information as to (i) the record owner(s) of all shares or securities\n\n         Beneficially Owned by such Person who is so believed to be a Related\n\n         Person, (ii) the number of, and class or series of, shares or\n\n         securities Beneficially Owned by such Person who is so believed to be\n\n         a Related Person and held of record by each such record owner and the\n\n         number(s) of the stock certificate(s) or instrument(s) evidencing such\n\n         shares or securities, and (iii) any other factual matter relating to\n\n         the applicability or effect of this Article SIXTH, as may reasonably\n\n         be requested of such Person, and such Person shall furnish such\n\n         information within ten days after the receipt of such demand.\n\n\n\n                 E.       Quorum.  Except as otherwise provided by law or\n\n         expressly provided in this Certificate of Incorporation, the presence,\n\n         in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of shares of capital\n\n         stock of the Corporation entitling the holders thereof to cast a\n\n         majority of the votes (after giving effect, if applicable, to the\n\n         provisions of Article FIFTH and this Article SIXTH) entitled to be\n\n         cast by the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation\n\n         entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the\n\n         stockholders, and every reference in this Certificate of Incorporation\n\n         to a majority or other proportion of capital stock (or the holders\n\n         thereof) for purposes of determining any quorum requirement or any\n\n         requirement for stockholder consent or approval shall be deemed to\n\n         refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes (or the\n\n         holders thereof) then entitled to be cast in respect of such capital\n\n         stock.\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\n<PAGE>   9\n\n                 SEVENTH: A.      Board of Directors.  The business and affairs\n\n         of the Corporation shall be under the direction of a board of\n\n         directors (the \"Board of Directors\"), except as provided in this\n\n         Certificate of Incorporation or in the Bylaws as in effect at the time\n\n         of the consummation of the conversion of the Savings Bank to a capital\n\n         stock savings bank and the Savings Bank concurrently becoming a\n\n         subsidiary of the Corporation.  The authorized number of directors\n\n         shall consist of not less than seven directors nor more than 16\n\n         directors.  The exact number of directors shall be fixed from time to\n\n         time pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a\n\n         majority of the Continuing Directors, in the manner provided by the\n\n         Bylaws of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n                 B.       Election of Directors.  The directors of the\n\n         Corporation shall be divided into three classes: the first class, the\n\n         second class and the third class.  Each director shall serve for a\n\n         term ending on the third annual meeting following the annual meeting\n\n         at which such director was elected; provided, however, that the\n\n         directors first elected to the first class shall serve for a term\n\n         ending upon the election of directors at the first annual meeting next\n\n         following the end of the fiscal year 1987, and the directors first\n\n         elected to the second class shall serve for a term ending upon the\n\n         election of directors at the second annual meeting next following the\n\n         end of the fiscal year 1988, and the directors first elected to the\n\n         third class shall serve for a term ending upon the election of the\n\n         directors at the third annual meeting next following the end of the\n\n         fiscal year 1989.  At each annual election, commencing at the first\n\n         annual meeting of stockholders, the successors to the class of\n\n         directors whose term expires at that time shall be elected by the\n\n         stockholders to hold office for a term of three years to succeed those\n\n         directors whose term expires, so that the term of one class of\n\n         directors shall expire each year.  In the event of any change in the\n\n         authorized number of directors, each director then continuing to serve\n\n         as such shall nevertheless continue as director of the class of which\n\n         he is a member until the expiration of his current term, or his prior\n\n         resignation, disqualification, disability or removal.\n\n\n\n                 C.       Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies.  Any\n\n         vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation,\n\n         retirement, disqualification, removal from office, an increase in the\n\n         number of authorized directors or other cause shall be filled only by\n\n         the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors,\n\n         including a majority of the Continuing Directors, although less than a\n\n         quorum, or by the sole remaining director, or, in the event of the\n\n         failure of the Board of Directors, or the Continuing Directors or sole\n\n         remaining director so to act, or if the Continuing Directors so\n\n         determine, by the stockholders at the next election of directors;\n\n         provided, however, that if the holders of any class or classes of\n\n         stock or series thereof of the Corporation, voting separately, are\n\n         entitled to elect one or more\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\n<PAGE>   10\n\n         directors, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or\n\n         classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected\n\n         by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a\n\n         sole remaining director so elected.  Directors so chosen shall hold\n\n         office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders at\n\n         which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires.\n\n         Any increase or decrease in the number of authorized directors may be\n\n         allocated to any such class as the majority of the Continuing\n\n         Directors selects in its discretion.  No decrease in the number of\n\n         directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term\n\n         of any incumbent director.\n\n\n\n                 D.       Removal.  A director may be removed only for cause as\n\n         determined by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a\n\n         majority of the shares entitled to vote generally in the election of\n\n         directors, which vote may only be taken at the annual meeting or at a\n\n         meeting of stockholders called expressly for that purpose.  Cause for\n\n         removal shall be deemed to exist only if the director whose removal is\n\n         proposed has been convicted of a felony by a court of competent\n\n         jurisdiction or has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction\n\n         to be liable for gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of\n\n         such director's duty to the Corporation.  At least thirty (30) days\n\n         prior to such meeting of stockholders, written notice shall be sent to\n\n         the director or directors whose removal will be considered at such\n\n         meeting.\n\n\n\n                 EIGHTH:  Action by Written Consent. After the consummation of\n\n         the conversion of the Savings Bank to a capital stock savings bank and\n\n         the Savings Bank concurrently becoming a Subsidiary of the\n\n         Corporation, the stockholders of the Corporation shall not be entitled\n\n         to take action by written consent in lieu of taking such action at an\n\n         annual or special meeting of stockholders.\n\n\n\n                 NINTH:  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the\n\n         stockholders may only be called by a majority of the Board of\n\n         Directors, including a majority of the Continuing Directors.\n\n\n\n                 TENTH: A.

Determination of Right to Indemnification. Any\n\n         indemnification under paragraphs A and B of this Article TWELFTH shall\n\n         be made by the Corporation as authorized in the specific case upon a\n\n         determination (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a\n\n         quorum of the directors who were not parties to such action, suit or\n\n         proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if\n\n         obtainable, if a majority of a quorum of disinterested directors so\n\n         directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion that\n\n         indemnification of the person seeking indemnification is proper in the\n\n         circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of\n\n         conduct set forth in paragraphs A and B of this Article TWELFTH.\n\n         Should a determination be made by the Corporation hereunder that\n\n         indemnification is not proper under the circumstances, a court may\n\n         order the Corporation to make indemnification pursuant to paragraphs A\n\n         or B of this Article TWELFTH.\n\n\n\n                 E.       Advance of Costs, Charges and Expenses. Costs,\n\n         charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees and related\n\n         disbursements) incurred by a person referred to in paragraphs A or B\n\n         of this Article TWELFTH in defending a civil or criminal action, suit\n\n         or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final\n\n         disposition of such action, suit or proceeding; provided, however,\n\n         that, if the Delaware Corporation Law so requires, the payment of such\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\n<PAGE>   19\n\n         expenses incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in his\n\n         or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other\n\n         capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a\n\n         director or officer, including without limitation, service to an\n\n         employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of such\n\n         action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an\n\n         undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay all\n\n         amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such\n\n         director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the\n\n         Corporation as authorized in this Article TWELFTH.  A majority of the\n\n         Continuing Directors may, upon approval of an indemnified person,\n\n         authorize the Corporation's counsel to represent such person, in any\n\n         action, suit or proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party\n\n         to such action, suit or proceeding.\n\n\n\n                 F.       Procedure for Indemnification: Right of Claimant to\n\n         Bring Suit. Any indemnification under paragraphs A, B and C, or\n\n         advance of costs, charges and expenses under paragraph E of this\n\n         Article TWELFTH, shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60\n\n         days (or in the case of any advance of costs, charges and expenses\n\n         under paragraph E, within 20 days), upon the written request of the\n\n         person referred to in such paragraphs.  The right to indemnification\n\n         or advances as granted by this Article TWELFTH shall be enforceable by\n\n         the persons referred to in paragraphs A, B, C and E in any court of\n\n         competent jurisdiction, if the Corporation denies such request, in\n\n         whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the\n\n         applicable time period specified in the preceding sentence hereof.\n\n         The costs, charges and expenses incurred by a person referred to in\n\n         paragraph A or B of this Article TWELFTH in connection with\n\n         successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in\n\n         whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the\n\n         Corporation.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an\n\n         action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges\n\n         and expenses under paragraph E of this Article TWELFTH where the\n\n         required undertaking, if any, has been received by the Corporation)\n\n         that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in\n\n         paragraphs A or B of this Article TWELFTH, but the burden of proving\n\n         such defense shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the\n\n         Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal\n\n         counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to\n\n         the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant\n\n         is proper in the circumstances because the claimant has met the\n\n         applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs A or B of this\n\n         Article TWELFTH, nor the fact that there has been an actual\n\n         determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or\n\n         its independent legal counsel) that the claimant has not met such\n\n         applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or\n\n         create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable\n\n         standard of conduct.\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\n<PAGE>   20\n\n                 G.       Other Rights; Continuation of Right to\n\n         Indemnification.  The indemnification and advancement of expenses\n\n         provided by this Article TWELFTH shall not be deemed exclusive of any\n\n         other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement\n\n         of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory),\n\n         bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholder or disinterested directors or\n\n         otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as\n\n         to action in another capacity while holding office or while employed\n\n         by or acting as agent for the Corporation, and the indemnification and\n\n         advancement of expenses provided by this Article TWELFTH shall\n\n         continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in a capacity referred\n\n         to in paragraph A or B and shall inure to the benefit of the estate,\n\n         heirs, executors and administrators of such person.  Nothing contained\n\n         in this Article TWELFTH shall be deemed to prohibit, and the\n\n         Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements\n\n         between the Corporation and directors, officers, employees or agents\n\n         providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those\n\n         set forth herein.  All rights to indemnification and advancement of\n\n         expenses under this Article TWELFTH shall be deemed to be a contract\n\n         between the Corporation and each person referred to in paragraph A or\n\n         B of this Article TWELFTH who serves or served in such capacity at any\n\n         time while this Article TWELFTH is in effect.

Savings Clause.  If this Article TWELFTH or any\n\n         portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of\n\n         competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless\n\n         indemnify each person referred to paragraph A or B of this Article\n\n         TWELFTH as to any cost, charge and expense (including attorneys' fees\n\n         and related disbursements), judgment, fine (including, without\n\n         limitation, ERISA excise taxes and penalties) and amount paid in\n\n         settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether\n\n         civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action\n\n         by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by\n\n         any applicable portion of this Article TWELFTH that shall not have\n\n         been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.\n\n\n\n                 K.

Non-enforceability of Provisions if Would Cause\n\n         Delisting.  No provision (or portion thereof) of this Certificate of\n\n         Incorporation shall be enforceable in a manner which would have the\n\n         effect of nullifying, restricting or disparately reducing the per\n\n         share voting rights of holders of an outstanding class or series of\n\n         common stock of the Corporation if (i) the Board of Directors receives\n\n         a written opinion of counsel, who shall be selected by a majority of\n\n         the Continuing Directors, that the manner of enforcing such provision\n\n         (or portion thereof), in the particular case, would prevent the\n\n         continuance of (A) listing of the common stock of the Corporation on\n\n         each national securities exchange on which the common stock is then\n\n         listed and (B) quotation and/or transaction reporting of the common\n\n         stock of the Corporation through each interdealer quotation system of\n\n         a national securities association on which the common stock is then\n\n         authorized for quotation or transaction reporting, (ii) a majority of\n\n         the Continuing Directors determines that the delisting of the common\n\n         stock from each such exchange and the removal of the common stock from\n\n         eligibility for inclusion on each such interdealer quotation system is\n\n         likely to have a material adverse effect on the market for the common\n\n         stock, and (iii) a certificate, signed by a majority of the Continuing\n\n         Directors, certifying that the conditions of clauses (i) and (ii) have\n\n         been satisfied is filed with the Secretary of the Corporation.

The first sentence of this paragraph notwithstanding,\n\n         the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation shall remain\n\n         applicable and enforceable as to all stockholders in any manner which,\n\n         in the written opinion of counsel selected by a majority of the\n\n         Continuing Directors, would not prevent the continued listing of\n\n         common stock of the Corporation on any national securities exchange on\n\n         which the common stock is then listed or quotation and/or transaction\n\n         reporting of the common stock of the Corporation through any\n\n         interdealer quotation\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\n<PAGE>   25\n\n         system of a national securities association on which the common stock\n\n         is then authorized for quotation or transaction reporting.\n\n\n\n         4.
