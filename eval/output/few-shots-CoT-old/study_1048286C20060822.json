Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be\n\ndesignated as \"Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock\" and the number\n\nof shares constituting such series shall be 800,000.\n\n\n\nSection 2. Dividends and Distributions.\n\n\n\n(A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of\n\nany series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of\n\nSeries A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the\n\nholders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be\n\nentitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of directors out of\n\nfunds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash\n\non the last day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such\n\ndate being referred to herein as a \"Quarterly Dividend Payment Date\"),\n\ncommencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first\n\nissuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to\n\nthe greater of (a) $10 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment\n\nhereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash\n\ndividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of\n\nall non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in\n\nshares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share of the corporation or\n\na subdivision of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (by\n\nreclassification or otherwise), declared on the Class A Common Stock, since\n\nthe immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to\n\nthe first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any\n\nshare or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.\n\nIn the event the corporation shall at any time after March 9, 1998 (the\n\n\"Rights Dividend Declaration Date\") (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common\n\nStock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the\n\noutstanding Class A Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A\n\nCommon Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the\n\namount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred\n\nStock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the\n\npreceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction\n\nthe numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock\n\noutstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the\n\nnumber of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately\n\nprior to such event.\n\n\n\n(B) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of\n\nSeries A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A\n\nJunior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares\n\nis prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in\n\nwhich case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of\n\nissue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of\n\nholders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to\n\nreceive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,\n\nin either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be\n\ncumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid\n\ndividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A\n\nJunior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount\n\nof such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be\n\nallocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time\n\noutstanding. The Board of directors may fix a record date for the\n\ndetermination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred\n\nStock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared\n\nthereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date\n\nfixed for the payment thereof.\n\n\n\nSection 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Junior\n\nParticipating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:\n\n\n\n(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share\n\nof Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder\n\nthereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders\n\nof the corporation. In the event the corporation shall at any time after the\n\nRights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common\n\nStock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the\n\noutstanding Class A Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A\n\nCommon Stock in a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number\n\nof votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be\n\nadjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is\n\nthe number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after\n\nsuch event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A\n\nCommon Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\n(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of\n\nSeries A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of\n\nClass A Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted\n\nto a vote of stockholders of the corporation.\n\n\n\n(C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly\n\ndividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning\n\nof a period (herein called a \"default period\") which shall extend until such\n\ntime when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend\n\nperiods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series\n\nA Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been\n\ndeclared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all\n\nholders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior\n\nParticipating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to\n\nsix (6) quarterly dividends thereto, voting as a class, irrespective of\n\nseries, shall have the right to elect two (2) Directors.\n\n\n\n(ii) During any default period, such voting rights of the holders of Series A\n\nJunior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special\n\nmeeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any\n\nannual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of\n\nstockholders, provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the\n\nholders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in\n\ncertain cases, the authorized number of Directors shall be exercised unless\n\nthe holders of one-third in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding\n\nshall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders\n\nof Class A Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of\n\nPreferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of\n\nPreferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing\n\ndefault period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect\n\nDirectors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may\n\nthen exist up to two (2) Directors, and if such right is exercised at an\n\nannual meeting, to elect two (2) Directors. If the number which may be so\n\nelected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the\n\nholders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in\n\nthe number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them\n\nof the required number. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have\n\nexercised their right to elect Directors in any default period and during the\n\ncontinuance of such period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or\n\ndecreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided\n\nor pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari\n\npassu with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default\n\nperiod, have previously exercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of\n\nDirectors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the\n\naggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of\n\nPreferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling\n\nof a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall\n\nthereupon be called by the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the\n\ncorporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders\n\nof Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph (C)(iii)\n\nshall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy\n\nof such notice to such holder at their last address as the same appears on the\n\nbooks of the corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier\n\nthan 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in\n\ndefault of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or\n\nrequest, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or\n\nstockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the\n\ntotal number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the\n\nprovisions of this paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called\n\nduring the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the\n\nnext annual meeting of the stockholders.\n\n\n\n(iv) In any default period, the holders of Class A Common Stock, and other\n\nclasses of stock of the corporation if applicable, shall continue to be\n\nentitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of Preferred\n\nStock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2) Directors voting as a\n\nclass, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the\n\nholders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until the successors shall\n\nhave been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default\n\nperiod, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of directors may (except as provided\n\nin paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the\n\nremaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock\n\nwhich elected the Director whose office shall have become vacant. References\n\nin this paragraph (C) to Directors elected by the holders of a particular\n\nclass of stock shall include Directors elected by such Directors to fill\n\nvacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.\n\n\n\n(v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the\n\nholders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the\n\nterm of any Directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class\n\nshall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may\n\nbe provided for in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws irrespective of\n\nany increase made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (C)(ii) of this\n\nSection 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any\n\nmanner provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws). Any\n\nvacancies in the Board of directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y)\n\nand (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining\n\nDirectors.\n\n\n\n(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall\n\nnot be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders\n\nof Class A Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.\n\n\n\nSection 4. Certain Restrictions.\n\n\n\n(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable\n\non the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2\n\nare in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and\n\ndistributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior\n\nParticipating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the\n\ncorporation shall not\n\n\n\n(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem,\n\npurchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking\n\njunior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)\n\nto the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;\n\n\n\n(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares\n\nof stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred\n\nStock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in\n\narrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such\n\nshares are then entitled;\n\n\n\n(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any\n\nstock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred\n\nStock, provided that the corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or\n\notherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of\n\nany stock of the corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon\n\ndissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock;\n\n\n\n(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A\n\nJunior Participating Preferred Stock, or any share of stock ranking on a\n\nparity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in\n\naccordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as\n\ndetermined by the Board of directors) to all holders of such shares upon such\n\nterms as the Board of directors, after consideration of the respective annual\n\ndividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective\n\nseries and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and\n\nequitable treatment among the respective series or classes.\n\n\n\n(B) The corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the corporation to\n\npurchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the\n\ncorporation unless the corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section\n\n4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.\n\n\n\nSection 5. Retired Shares. Any shares of Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the corporation in any\n\nmanner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the\n\nacquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become\n\nauthorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part\n\nof a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions\n\nof the board of directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on\n\nissuance set forth herein.\n\n\n\nSection 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.\n\n\n\n(A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up\n\nof the corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of\n\nstock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution\n\nor winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless,\n\nprior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock shall have received $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to\n\naccrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not\n\ndeclared, to the date of such payment (the \"Series A Liquidation Preference\").\n\nFollowing the payment of the full amount of Series A Liquidation Preference,\n\nno additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A\n\nJunior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of\n\nshares of Class A Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the\n\n\"Common Adjustment\") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series\n\nA Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth\n\nin subparagraph C below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock\n\ndividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Class A Common Stock)\n\n(such number in clause (ii) immediately above being referred to as the\n\n\"Adjustment Number\"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A\n\nLiquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding\n\nshares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Class A Common\n\nStock, respectively, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock\n\nand holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall receive their ratable and\n\nproportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of\n\nthe Adjustment Number to one (1) with respect to such Preferred Stock and\n\nClass A Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.\n\n\n\n(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to\n\npermit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the\n\nliquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, which\n\nrank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then\n\nsuch remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such\n\nparity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In\n\nthe event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit\n\npayment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be\n\ndistributed ratably to the holders of Class A Common Stock.\n\n\n\n(C) In the event the corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend\n\nDeclaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common Stock payable in\n\nshares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Class A Common\n\nStock or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A Common Stock into a smaller\n\nnumber of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect\n\nimmediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such\n\nAdjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares\n\nof Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the\n\ndenominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were\n\noutstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\nSection 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the corporation shall enter\n\ninto any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the\n\nshares of Class A Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock\n\nor securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the\n\nshares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time\n\nbe similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the\n\nprovision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the\n\naggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable\n\nin kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Class A\n\nCommon Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the corporation shall at\n\nany time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend\n\non Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii)\n\nsubdivide the outstanding Class A Common Stock or (iii) combine the\n\noutstanding Class A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each\n\nsuch case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the\n\nexchange or change of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock\n\nshall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of\n\nwhich is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately\n\nafter such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class\n\nA Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\nSection 8. No Redemption. The shares of Series A Junior Participating\n\nPreferred Stock shall not be redeemable.\n\n\n\nSection 9. Ranking. The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall\n\nrank junior to all other series of the corporation's Preferred Stock as to the\n\npayment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any\n\nsuch series shall provide otherwise.\n\n\n\nSection 10. Amendment. The Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation\n\nshall not be further amended in any manner which would materially alter or\n\nchange the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Junior\n\nParticipating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the\n\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding\n\nshares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as\n\na class.\n\n\n\nSection 11. Fractional Shares. Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock\n\nmay be issued in fractions of a share but no such fraction shall be less than\n\none one-thousandth of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to\n\nsuch holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends,\n\nparticipate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of\n\nholders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.\n\n", "completion": {"answer": "Y", "reference": ["No director of the corporation shall be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages, for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit."], "reason": "The charter explicitly states that no director shall be liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except under specific circumstances.
