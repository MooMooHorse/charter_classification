Every  such\n\nnotice of election to convert shall constitute a contract between the holder\n\nof  such Class B Stock and the Corporation, whereby the holder of such Class\n\nB  Stock shall be deemed to subscribe for the amount of Class A Stock  which\n\nhe  shall  be entitled to receive upon such conversion, and, in satisfaction\n\nof  such subscription, to deposit the Class B Stock to be converted  and  to\n\nrelease  the  Corporation  from all liability thereunder,  and  thereby  the\n\nCorporation  shall be deemed to agree that the surrender of the  certificate\n\nor  certificates therefor and the extinguishment of liability thereon  shall\n\nconstitute full payment of such subscription for Common Stock to  be  issued\n\nupon  such  conversion.  The Corporation will as soon as  practicable  after\n\nsuch deposit of a certificate or certificates for Class B Stock, accompanied\n\nby  the written notice and the statement above prescribed, issue and deliver\n\nat  the office of said transfer agent (or other place as provided above)  to\n\nthe  person for whose account such Class B Stock was so surrendered,  or  to\n\nhis  nominee  or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the  number  of\n\nfull  shares  of Class A Stock to which he shall be entitled  as  aforesaid.\n\nSubject  to  the  provision  of  subsection (3)  of  this  Section  D,  such\n\nconversion  shall  be  deemed to have been made  as  of  the  date  of  such\n\nsurrender  of the Class B Stock to be converted; and the person  or  persons\n\nentitled to receive the Class A Stock issuable upon conversion of such Class\n\nB Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of\n\nsuch Class A Stock on such date.\n\n\n\n          (2)  The issuance of certificates for shares of Class A Stock upon\n\nconversion of shares of Class B Stock shall be made without charge  for  any\n\nstamp  or  other similar tax in respect of such issuance.  However,  if  any\n\nsuch certificate is to be issued in a name other than that of the holder  of\n\nthe  share  or  shares  of Class B Stock converted, the  person  or  persons\n\nrequesting the issuance thereof shall pay to the Corporation the  amount  of\n\nany  tax  which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved  in  such\n\nissuance or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such\n\ntax has been paid.\n\n\n\n                                     39\n\n<PAGE>\n\n          \n\n          (3)   The  Corporation shall not be required to  convert  Class  B\n\nStock,  and  no  surrender  of Class B Stock shall  be  effective  for  that\n\npurpose,  while the stock transfer books of the Corporation are  closed  for\n\nany  purpose; but the surrender of Class B Stock for conversion  during  any\n\nperiod  while such books are so closed shall become effective for conversion\n\nimmediately upon the reopening of such books, as if the conversion had  been\n\nmade on the date such Class B Stock was surrendered.\n\n\n\n          (4)   The  Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve\n\nand  keep available, solely for the purpose of issue upon conversion of  the\n\noutstanding shares of Class B Stock, such number of shares of Class A  Stock\n\nas  shall  be  issuable upon the conversion of all such outstanding  shares,\n\nprovided  that nothing contained herein shall be construed to  preclude  the\n\nCorporation from satisfying its obligations in respect of the conversion  of\n\nthe  outstanding shares of Class B Stock by delivery of shares  of  Class  A\n\nStock  which  are held in the treasury of the Corporation.  The  Corporation\n\ncovenants  that  all  shares of Class A Stock which  shall  be  issued  upon\n\nconversion  of the shares of Class B Stock, will, upon issue, be fully  paid\n\nand nonassessable and not entitled to any preemptive rights.  All shares  of\n\nClass  A  Stock  acquired in exchange for shares of Class B  Stock  and  all\n\nshares of Class B Stock converted into Class A Stock shall be cancelled  and\n\nrestored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Stock or\n\nClass B Stock, as the case may be.\n\n\n\n            (5) At any time when the Board of Directors and the holders of a\n\nmajority  of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock approve the  conversion\n\nof  all of the Class B Stock into Class A Stock, then the outstanding shares\n\nof  Class B Stock shall be converted into shares of Class A Stock.   In  the\n\nevent  of  such a conversion, certificates formerly representing outstanding\n\nshares  of  Class  B  Stock  shall thereupon and  thereafter  be  deemed  to\n\nrepresent the like number of shares of Class A Stock.\n\n\n\n     E.   Liquidation Rights.\n\n\n\n     In  the  event  of any dissolution, liquidation or winding  up  of  the\n\naffairs  of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment\n\nor  provision  for  payment  of  the debts  and  other  liabilities  of  the\n\nCorporation,  the  remaining assets and funds of the  Corporation,  if  any,\n\nshall be divided among and paid ratably to the holders of Class A Stock  and\n\nthe  holders of Class B Stock.  A merger or consolidation of the Corporation\n\nwith  or  into any other corporation or a sale or conveyance of all  or  any\n\npart of the assets of the Corporation (which shall not in fact result in the\n\nliquidation   of  the  Corporation  and  the  distribution  of   assets   to\n\nshareholders)  shall  not  be  deemed  to  be  a  voluntary  or  involuntary\n\nliquidation  or  dissolution  or winding up of the  Corporation  within  the\n\nmeaning of this Section E.\n\n\n\n                                     40\n\n<PAGE>\n\n     \n\n     F.   Preemptive Rights.\n\n\n\n     Subject  to any conversion rights of the holders of Class B  Stock,  no\n\nholder of either Class A Stock or Class B Stock of the Corporation shall  be\n\nentitled  as of right to subscribe for or receive any part of the authorized\n\nstock  of  the  Corporation or any part of any new, additional or  increased\n\nissues  of  stock  of any class or of any obligations convertible  into  any\n\nclass  or classes of stock, but the Board of Directors may, without offering\n\nany  such  shares  of  stock  or  obligations  convertible  into  stock   to\n\nshareholders  of any class, issue and sell or dispose of the  sale  to  such\n\npersons and for such considerations permitted by law as it may from time  to\n\ntime in its absolute discretion determine.\n\n\n\n     FIFTH:     I.
