Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise\n\nprovided in Clause (c) of this Article XV, the Corporation shall be required\n\nto indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part\n\nthereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such\n\nProceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the\n\nspecific case by the Board of Directors. On no account shall any amendment to\n\napplicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended be deemed to\n\nlimit or prohibit the right to indemnification in this Article XV for past\n\nactions or omissions of any Covered Person insofar as such amendment limits or\n\nprohibits the indemnification rights that said law permitted the Corporation\n\nto provide prior to such amendment. Persons who are not directors or officers\n\nof the Corporation and are not serving at the request of the Corporation may\n\nbe similarly indemnified in respect of such service to the extent authorized\n\nat any time by the Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(d)The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable\n\nlaw pay the expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by a Covered Person\n\nin defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,\n\nhowever, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in\n\nadvance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon\n\nreceipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced\n\nif it should be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that\n\nthe Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article XV or\n\notherwise.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(e)If a claim for indemnification under this Article XV (following the final\n\ndisposition of such Proceeding) is not paid in full within sixty (60) days\n\nafter the Corporation has received a claim therefor by the Covered Person, or\n\nif a claim for any advancement of expenses under this Article XV is not paid\n\nin full within thirty (30) days after the Corporation has received a statement\n\nor statements requesting such amounts to be advanced, the Covered Person shall\n\nthereupon (but not before) be entitled to file suit to recover the unpaid\n\namount of such claim. If successful in whole or in part, the Covered Person\n\nshall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the\n\nfullest extent permitted by law. In any such action, the Corporation shall\n\nhave the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the\n\nrequested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(f)The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Article XV shall not be\n\nexclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter\n\nacquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, the\n\nbylaws of the Corporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested\n\ndirectors or otherwise.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(g)This Article XV shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent\n\nand in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to\n\npersons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate\n\ncorporate action.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(h)Any Covered Person entitled to indemnification and/or advancement of\n\nexpenses, in each case pursuant to this Article XV, may have certain rights to\n\nindemnification, advancement and/or insurance provided by one or more persons\n\nwith whom or which such Covered Person may be associated. The Corporation\n\nhereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Corporation shall be the\n\nindemnitor of first resort with respect to any Proceeding, expense, liability\n\nor matter that is the subject of this Article XV, (ii) the Corporation shall\n\nbe primarily liable for all such obligations and any indemnification afforded\n\nto a Covered Person in respect of a Proceeding, expense, liability or matter\n\nthat is the subject of this Article XV, whether created by law, organizational\n\nor constituent documents, contract or otherwise, (iii) any obligation of any\n\npersons with whom or which a Covered Person may be associated to indemnify\n\nsuch Covered Person and/or advance expenses or liabilities to such Covered\n\nPerson in respect of any Proceeding shall be secondary to the obligations of\n\nthe Corporation hereunder, (iv) the Corporation shall be required to indemnify\n\neach Covered Person and advance expenses to each Covered Person hereunder to\n\nthe fullest extent provided herein without regard to any rights such Covered\n\nPerson may have against any other person with whom or which such Covered\n\nPerson may be associated or insurer of any such person, and (v) the\n\nCorporation irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases any other person\n\nwith whom or which a Covered Person may be associated from any claim of\n\ncontribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of\n\namounts paid by the Corporation hereunder.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(i)Any right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses of any Covered\n\nPerson arising hereunder shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment\n\nto or repeal of this Certificate of Incorporation after the occurrence of the\n\nact or omission that is the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or\n\ninvestigative action, suit or Proceeding for which indemnification or\n\nadvancement of expenses is sought.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n6\\.
