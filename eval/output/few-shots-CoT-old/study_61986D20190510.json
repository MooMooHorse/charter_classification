All dividends on Preferred Stock shall be without\n\npriority as between series, shall be paid out of net earnings or any surplus\n\nproperly applicable to the payment of dividends, and shall be paid or set\n\napart before any dividends or other distributions shall be paid or set apart\n\nfor Common Stock; provided, however, that dividends may be declared and paid\n\non Common Stock in Common Stock prior to dividends on the Preferred Stock\n\nbeing paid or set apart. Any dividends paid upon the Preferred Stock in an\n\namount less than full cumulative dividends accrued and in arrears upon all\n\nPreferred Stock outstanding shall, if more than one series be outstanding, be\n\ndistributed among the different series in proportion to the aggregate amounts\n\nwhich would be distributable to the Preferred Stock of each series if full\n\ncumulative dividends were declared and paid thereon. The dividends on the\n\nPreferred Stock shall be cumulative, so that if at any time the full amount of\n\ndividends accrued and in arrears on the Preferred Stock shall not be paid, the\n\ndeficiency shall be payable before any dividends or other distributions shall\n\nbe paid or set apart on Common Stock (other than a distribution payable on\n\nshares of Common Stock), and before any sums shall be paid or set apart for\n\nthe redemption of less than all of the Preferred Stock then outstanding.\n\nDividends on Preferred Stock shall accrue from date of issue.

In the event of the involuntary\n\nliquidation of the corporation, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be\n\nentitled to receive out of the assets of the corporation in full the fixed\n\ninvoluntary liquidation amount thereof, plus accrued dividends thereon, all as\n\nprovided in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance thereof,\n\nbefore any amount shall be paid to the holders of Common Stock. If, upon the\n\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation or winding up of the corporation, the\n\nassets of the corporation shall be insufficient to pay the holders of all of\n\nthe Preferred Stock the entire amounts to which they may be entitled, the\n\nassets of the corporation shall, if more than one series be outstanding, be\n\ndistributed among the different series in proportion to the aggregate amounts\n\nwhich would be distributable to the Preferred Stock of each series if\n\nsufficient assets were available. The holders of Preferred Stock shall not\n\notherwise be entitled to participate in any distribution of assets of the\n\ncorporation, which shall be divided or distributed among the holders of Common\n\nStock. No consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into another\n\ncorporation or corporations and no sale by the corporation of all or\n\nsubstantially all of its assets shall be deemed a liquidation or winding up of\n\nthe corporation.\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSection 8.5.Voting Rights of Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\nThe holders of Preferred Stock shall have only such voting rights as shall be\n\nstated in the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing\n\nfor the issuance thereof, except to the extent that such limitation may be\n\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.\n\n\n\nARTICLE IX  \n\nAmendments\n\n\n\nSection 9.1.Amendments\n\n\n\nThese Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation may be amended in the\n\nmanner authorized by law at the time of the amendment.\n\n\n\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n", "completion": {"answer": "Y", "reference": ["Section 4.4.Indemnification."], "reason": "The charter explicitly states that the corporation may indemnify any of its directors and officers for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty within the limitations prescribed by law.
