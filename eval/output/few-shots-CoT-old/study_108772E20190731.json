Whenever the\n\nConversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the\n\nCorporation shall mail to Holder(s) a notice of the increase, which notice\n\nwill be given at least 15 calendar days prior to the effectiveness of any such\n\nincrease, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the\n\nperiod during which it will be in effect.\n\n\n\n(xiii) If during a period applicable for calculating the Closing Price of\n\nCommon Stock or any other security, an event occurs that requires an\n\nadjustment to the Conversion Rate, the Closing Price of such security shall be\n\ncalculated for such period in a manner reasonably determined by the\n\nCorporation to appropriately reflect the impact of such event on the price of\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nsuch security during such period. Whenever any provision of this Subdivision\n\n13 requires a calculation of an average of Closing Prices of Common Stock or\n\nany other security over multiple days, appropriate adjustments shall be made\n\nto account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective,\n\nor any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Record\n\nDate of the event occurs, at any time during the period during which the\n\naverage is to be calculated.\n\n\n\n(xiv) Whenever the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted in accordance with\n\nSubdivision 13(j), the Corporation shall compute the Conversion Rate in\n\naccordance with Subdivision 13(j), taking into account Subdivision 13(j)(ix),\n\nand provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holder(s) of the\n\noccurrence of such event and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate.\n\n\n\n(xv) Rights Plans. If the Corporation has a rights plan in effect with respect\n\nto the Common Stock on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any Conversion Date,\n\nupon conversion of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Holder of\n\nsuch shares will receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the\n\nrights under the rights plan relating to such Common Stock, unless, prior to\n\nthe Mandatory Conversion Date or such Conversion Date, the rights have (x)\n\nbecome exercisable or (y) separated from the shares of Common Stock in\n\naccordance with the provisions of such rights plan (the first of events to\n\noccur being the \u0093Trigger Event\u0094), in either of which cases the Conversion Rate\n\nwill be adjusted, effective automatically at the time of such Trigger Event,\n\nas if the Corporation had made a distribution of such rights to all holders of\n\nthe Common Stock as described in Subdivision 13(j)(iv) (without giving effect\n\nto the 60 day limit on the exercisability of rights and warrants ordinarily\n\nsubject to such Subdivision 13(j)(iv)), subject to appropriate readjustment in\n\nthe event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights prior to\n\nthe exercise, deemed exercise or exchange thereof. Notwithstanding the\n\nforegoing, to the extent any such stockholder rights are exchanged by the\n\nCorporation for shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be\n\nappropriately readjusted as if such stockholder rights had not been issued,\n\nbut the Corporation had instead issued the shares of Common Stock issued upon\n\nsuch exchange as a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock subject\n\nto Subdivision 13(j)(ii).\n\n\n\n(k) Reorganization Events.\n\n\n\n(i) In the event that there occurs:\n\n\n\n(A) any consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Corporation\n\nwith or into another Person;\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(B) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or\n\nsubstantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation;\n\n\n\n(C) any reclassification, recapitalization or reorganization of the\n\nCorporation; or\n\n\n\n(D) any statutory exchange of the outstanding shares of Common Stock for\n\nsecurities of another Person (other than in connection with a consolidation,\n\nmerger or other business combination);\n\n\n\nand in each case, the holders of the Common Stock receive stock, other\n\nsecurities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination\n\nthereof) with respect to or in exchange for the Common Stock (any such event\n\nor transaction, a \u0093Reorganization Event\u0094) each share of Series A Preferred\n\nStock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall,\n\nwithout notice to or consent of the Holder(s) and subject to Subdivision\n\n13(k)(v), become convertible (but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be\n\nautomatically converted in connection with such Reorganization Event) into the\n\nkind of securities, cash and other property received in such Reorganization\n\nEvent by the holders of the Common Stock (other than the counterparty to the\n\nReorganization Event or an Affiliate of such counterparty) (such securities,\n\ncash and other property, the \u0093Exchange Property\u0094).\n\n\n\n(ii) In the event that holders of the shares of Common Stock have the\n\nopportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such\n\ntransaction, the consideration that the Holder(s) are entitled to receive upon\n\nconversion shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration\n\nreceived by a majority of the holders of the shares of Common Stock that did\n\nmake an affirmative election.\n\n\n\n(iii) The above provisions of this Subdivision 13(k) shall similarly apply to\n\nsuccessive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Subdivision 13(j) shall\n\napply to any shares of capital stock received by the holders of Common Stock\n\nin any such Reorganization Event.\n\n\n\n(iv) The Corporation (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the\n\nconsummation of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the\n\nHolder(s) of such consummation of such event and of the kind and amount of the\n\ncash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property.\n\nFailure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this\n\nSubdivision 13(k).\n\n\n\n(v) The Corporation shall not enter into any agreement for a transaction\n\nconstituting a Reorganization Event unless:\n\n\n\n(A) such agreement provides for, or does not interfere with or prevent (as\n\napplicable), conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into the Exchange\n\nProperty in a manner that is consistent with and gives effect to this\n\nSubdivision 13(k); and\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(B) to the extent that the Corporation is not the surviving corporation in\n\nsuch Reorganization Event or will be dissolved in connection with such\n\nReorganization Event, proper provision shall be made in the agreements\n\ngoverning such Reorganization Event for the conversion of the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock into stock of the Person surviving such Reorganization Event\n\nor, in the case of a Reorganization Event described in Subdivision\n\n13(k)(i)(B), an exchange of Series A Preferred Stock for the stock of the\n\nPerson to whom the Corporation\u0092s assets are conveyed or transferred, and such\n\nstock of the Person surviving such Reorganization Event or to whom the\n\nCorporation\u0092s assets are conveyed or transferred shall have voting powers,\n\npreferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights as\n\nnearly equal as possible to those provided in this Certificate of\n\nIncorporation.\n\n\n\n(l) Holder\u0092s Right to Convert Upon a Make-Whole Acquisition.\n\n\n\n(i) In addition to any other rights of conversion set forth herein, in the\n\nevent a Make-Whole Acquisition occurs, each Holder shall have the right, at\n\nsuch Holder\u0092s option, to convert all or any portion of such Holder\u0092s shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock during the period (the\n\n\u0093Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion Period\u0094) beginning on the effective date of\n\nthe Make-Whole Acquisition (the \u0093Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date\u0094) and\n\nending on the date that is 30 calendar days after the Make-Whole Acquisition\n\nEffective Date at the Applicable Conversion Rate, plus a number of additional\n\nshares of Common Stock (the \u0093Additional Shares\u0094) determined pursuant to\n\nSubdivision 13(l)(ii), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, plus an amount\n\nequal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock so converted through the date of such conversion, subject to compliance\n\nwith the conversion procedures set forth in Subdivision 13(i).\n\n\n\n(ii) The number of Additional Shares per share of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nshall be determined by reference to the table below for the applicable Make-\n\nWhole Acquisition Effective Date and the applicable Make-Whole Acquisition\n\nStock Price:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |

In the event that a\n\nHolder fails to notify the Corporation of the number of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock which such Holder wishes to have redeemed, such Holder shall\n\nbe deemed to have elected to have redeemed all shares represented by the\n\ncertificate or certificates surrendered for redemption.\n\n\n\n(iv) Exercise by a Holder of such Holder\u0092s special redemption right following\n\na Fundamental Change is irrevocable, except that a Holder may withdraw its\n\nelection to exercise such Holder\u0092s special redemption right at any time on or\n\nbefore the Fundamental Change Redemption Date by delivering a written or\n\nfacsimile transmission notice to the Corporation at the address or facsimile\n\nnumber specified in the Fundamental Change Notice. Such notice, to be\n\neffective, must be received by the Corporation prior to the close of business\n\non the Fundamental Change Redemption Date.
