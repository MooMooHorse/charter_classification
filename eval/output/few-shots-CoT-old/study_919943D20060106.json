The Class C Common Stock shall be convertible into a number of\n\nshares of Class A Common Stock (the \"Aggregate Class C Conversion Shares\")\n\nequal to the greater of (A) 3% of the Aggregate Conversion Shares and (B)\n\nthe sum of (I) the Class C Capital Share Number, plus (II) the product of\n\n(x) .440 and (y) the Conversion Excess. Each share of Class C Common Stock\n\nbeing converted shall convert into a number of shares of Class A Common\n\nStock equal to the Aggregate Class C Conversion Shares divided by the\n\nnumber of shares of Class C Common Stock outstanding as of the date of\n\nconversion.\n\n\n\n                                    (iii) In the case of any partial\n\nconversion of Class B Common Stock by the holders thereof, selection of the\n\nClass C Common Stock for automatic conversion will be made by the\n\nCorporation in compliance with the requirements of the principal national\n\nsecurities exchange, if any, on which the Class C Common Stock is listed,\n\nor if the Class C Common Stock is not listed on a national securities\n\nexchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or such other method as the\n\nCorporation, in its sole discretion, shall deem fair and appropriate.\n\n\n\n                           (B) (i) In order to effect a Conversion, the\n\nholder of the shares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as\n\napplicable, to be converted shall surrender the certificate representing\n\nsuch shares at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, with a\n\nwritten notice of election to convert completed and signed, specifying the\n\nnumber of shares to be converted.\n\n\n\n                                    (ii) Unless the shares issuable on a\n\nConversion are to be issued in the same name as the name in which such\n\nshares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as applicable, are\n\nregistered, each share surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by\n\ninstruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly\n\nexecuted by the holder or the holder's duly authorized attorney, and an\n\namount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax.\n\n\n\n                                    (iii) As promptly as practicable after\n\nthe surrender by the holder of the certificates for shares of Class B\n\nCommon Stock or Class C Common Stock, as applicable, as aforesaid, the\n\nCorporation shall issue and shall deliver to such holder, or on the\n\nholder's written order to the holder's transferee, (x) a certificate or\n\ncertificates for the whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock\n\nissuable upon the conversion of such shares in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of this Section 4.3.3, (y) any cash adjustment required pursuant\n\nto Section 4.3.3(E), and (z) in the event of a conversion in part, a\n\ncertificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of Class B\n\nCommon Stock or Class C Common Stock, as applicable, not being so\n\nconverted.\n\n\n\n                                    (iv) Each conversion of shares of Class\n\nB Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as applicable, pursuant to Section\n\n4.3.3(A) shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the\n\nclose of business on the date on which the certificates for such shares\n\nshall have been surrendered and such notice received by the Corporation as\n\naforesaid, and the person in whose name or names any certificate or\n\ncertificates for shares of Class A Common Stock shall be issuable upon any\n\nsuch conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the\n\nshares of Class A Common Stock represented thereby at such time on such\n\ndate, and such conversion shall be into a number of whole shares of Class A\n\nCommon Stock in respect of the shares of Class B Common Stock or Class C\n\nCommon Stock, as applicable, being converted as determined in accordance\n\nwith this Section 4.3.3 at such time on such date. All shares of Class A\n\nCommon Stock delivered upon conversion of the Class B Common Stock or Class\n\nC Common Stock, as applicable, will upon delivery be duly and validly\n\nissued and fully paid and non-assessable, free of all liens and charges and\n\nnot subject to any preemptive rights. Upon the surrender of certificates\n\nrepresenting the shares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as\n\napplicable, to be converted, the shares to be so converted shall no longer\n\nbe deemed to be outstanding and all rights of a holder with respect to such\n\nshares surrendered for conversion shall immediately terminate except the\n\nright to receive the Class A Common Stock and other amounts payable\n\npursuant to this Section 4.3.3 and a certificate or certificates\n\nrepresenting the shares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as\n\napplicable, not converted.\n\n\n\n                           (C) (i) The Corporation will at all times\n\nreserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, such number of its\n\nauthorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock as shall be required\n\nfor the purpose of effecting conversions of the Class B Common Stock and\n\nthe Class C Common Stock.\n\n\n\n                                    (ii) Prior to the delivery of any\n\nsecurities which the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon\n\nconversion of the Class B Common Stock and the Class C Common Stock, the\n\nCorporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and\n\nregulations which require action to be taken by the Corporation.\n\n\n\n                           (D) The Corporation will pay any and all\n\ndocumentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of\n\nthe issue or delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock on conversion of\n\nthe Class B Common Stock and the Class C Common Stock pursuant hereto;\n\nprovided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which\n\nmay be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery\n\nof shares of Class A Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder\n\nof the shares to be converted and no such issue or delivery shall be made\n\nunless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to\n\nthe Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the\n\nsatisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.\n\n\n\n                           (E) In connection with the conversion of any\n\nshares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as applicable, no\n\nfractions of shares of Class A Common Stock shall be required to be issued\n\nto the holder of such shares, but in lieu thereof the Corporation shall pay\n\na cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal\n\nto such fractional interest multiplied by the Market Price per share of\n\nClass A Common Stock on the business day next preceding the date of\n\nconversion.\n\n\n\n                           (F) (i) In case the Corporation shall at any\n\ntime (A) declare a dividend or make a distribution on the Class A Common\n\nStock payable in Class A Common Stock, (B) subdivide or split the\n\noutstanding Class A Common Stock, (C) combine or reclassify the outstanding\n\nClass A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, (D) issue any shares\n\nof its capital stock in a reclassification of the Class A Common Stock\n\n(including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or\n\nmerger in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation), or (E)\n\nconsolidate with, or merge with or into, any other person, appropriate\n\nadjustment shall be made so that the conversion of the Class B Common Stock\n\nand the Class C Common Stock after such time shall entitle the holders of\n\nthe Class B Common Stock and the Class C Common Stock, in the aggregate, to\n\nreceive the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock or other\n\nsecurities of the Corporation (or other securities into which such shares\n\nof Class A Common Stock have been converted, exchanged, combined,\n\nconsolidated, merged or reclassified pursuant to clause (C), (D) or (E) of\n\nthis Section 4.3.3(F)(i)) which, if the Class B Common Stock and Class C\n\nCommon Stock had been converted immediately prior to such time, the holders\n\nof Class B Common Stock and the Class C Common Stock, in the aggregate,\n\nwould have owned upon such conversion and been entitled to receive by\n\nvirtue of such dividend, distribution, subdivision, split, combination,\n\nconsolidation, merger or reclassification.
