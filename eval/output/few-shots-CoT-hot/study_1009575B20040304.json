This corporation shall, as soon as practicable \n\nthereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred \n\nStock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or \n\ncertificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder \n\nshall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the \n\namount of any declared and unpaid dividends payable pursuant to paragraph (a) \n\nof Section 3 hereof, if any.  Such conversion shall be deemed to have been \n\nmade immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender \n\nof the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, or, in the case of \n\nautomatic conversion, immediately prior to the occurrence of the event \n\nleading to such automatic conversion, and the person or persons entitled to \n\nreceive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be \n\ntreated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of \n\nCommon Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an \n\nunderwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Act, the \n\nconversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for \n\nconversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale \n\nof securities pursuant to such offering; in which event the person(s) \n\nentitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the \n\nPreferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock \n\nuntil immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.\n\n\n\n          (d)  CONVERSION PRICE ADJUSTMENTS OF PREFERRED STOCK.

In the event this corporation shall issue Additional Shares\n\nof Common (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to\n\nSection 3(d)(iii)) without consideration or for a consideration per share less\n\nthan the Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such\n\nissue, then and in each such event such Conversion Price shall be reduced to a\n\nprice (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion\n\nPrice by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of\n\nCommon Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the\n\ncorporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would\n\npurchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue\n\nplus the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued; provided that,\n\nfor the purposes of this Section 3(d)(iv), all shares of Common Stock issuable\n\nupon conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock, all outstanding Options and\n\nall outstanding Convertible Securities shall be deemed to be outstanding, and,\n\nimmediately after any Additional Shares of Common are deemed issued pursuant to\n\nSection 3(d)(iii), such Additional Shares of Common shall be deemed to be\n\noutstanding.\n\n               \n\n               (v)  DETERMINATION OF CONSIDERATION.  For purposes of this\n\nSection 3(d), the consideration received by the corporation for the issue of any\n\nAdditional Shares of Common shall be computed as follows:\n\n\n\n                    (1)  CASH AND PROPERTY:  Such consideration shall:\n\n\n\n                         (A)  insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the\n\naggregate amount of cash received by the corporation;\n\n\n\n                         (B)  insofar as it consists of property other than\n\ncash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as\n\ndetermined in the good faith by the Board of Directors ; and\n\n                         \n\n                         (C)  in the event Additional Shares of Common are\n\nissued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the\n\ncorporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such\n\nconsideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (A) and (B) above, as\n\ndetermined in good faith by the Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n                    (2)  OPTIONS AND CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES.  The consideration\n\nper share received by the corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to\n\nhave been issued pursuant to Section 3(d)(iii), relating to Options and\n\nConvertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing\n\n\n\n                         (A)  the total amount, if any, received or receivable\n\nby the corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible\n\nSecurities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as\n\nset forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision\n\ncontained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to\n\nthe corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or \n\n\n\n                                       7\n\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nexchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for \n\nConvertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible \n\nSecurities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by\n\n                         \n\n                         (B)  the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as\n\nset forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision\n\ncontained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the\n\nexercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible\n\nSecurities.\n\n\n\n               (vi) OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO CONVERSION PRICE.  The Conversion\n\nPrices shall be subject to adjustments from time to time as follows: \n\n\n\n                    (1)  ADJUSTMENTS FOR SUBDIVISIONS OR COMBINATIONS OF COMMON\n\nSTOCK.  In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided\n\nby stock split, stock dividend or otherwise, into a greater number of shares of\n\nCommon Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in\n\neffect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be\n\nproportionately decreased.  In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock\n\nshall be combined or consolidated into a lesser number of shares of Common\n\nStock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock then in effect\n\nshall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation,\n\nbe proportionately increased.\n\n                    \n\n                    (2)  ADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK DIVIDENDS AND OTHER\n\nDISTRIBUTIONS.  In the event the corporation makes, or fixes a record date for\n\nthe determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, any\n\ndistribution (excluding repurchases of securities by the corporation not made on\n\na pro rata basis) payable in property or in securities of the corporation other\n\nthan shares of Common Stock, and other than as otherwise adjusted for in this\n\nSection 3 or as provided in Section 1 in connection with a dividend, then and in\n\neach such event the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, at the time of\n\nsuch distribution, the amount of property or the number of securities of the\n\ncorporation that they would have received had their Preferred Stock been\n\nconverted into Common Stock on the date of such event.\n\n                    \n\n                    (3)  ADJUSTMENTS FOR REORGANIZATIONS, RECLASSIFICATIONS OR\n\nSIMILAR EVENTS.
