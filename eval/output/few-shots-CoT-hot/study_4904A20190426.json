Directors shall hold office after the expiration of\n\n     their terms until their successors are elected and have\n\n     qualified.  Directors need not be stockholders.\n\n\n\n          6.  To the fullest extent permitted by the New York\n\n     Business Corporation Law as it exists on the date hereof or\n\n     as it may hereafter be amended, no director of the\n\n     corporation shall be liable to the corporation or its\n\n     stockholders for damages for any breach of duty as a\n\n     director.  Any repeal or modification of the foregoing\n\n     sentence by the stockholders of the corporation shall not\n\n     adversely affect any right or protection of a director of\n\n     the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or\n\n     modification.\n\n\n\n          7.1.(A)  In addition to any affirmative vote required\n\n     by law or this certificate of incorporation (any other\n\n     provision of this certificate of incorporation\n\n     notwithstanding), and except as otherwise expressly provided\n\n     in paragraph 7.2:\n\n\n\n               (1)  any merger or consolidation of the\n\n          corporation or any Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined)\n\n          with (i) any Interested Stockholder (as hereinafter\n\n          defined) or (ii) any other corporation (whether or not\n\n          itself an Interested Stockholder) which is, or after\n\n          such merger or consolidation would be, an Affiliate (as\n\n          hereinafter defined) of an Interested Stockholder; or\n\n\n\n               (2)  any sale, lease, license, exchange, mortgage,\n\n          pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one\n\n          transaction or a series of transactions) to or with any\n\n          Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any\n\n          Interested Stockholder of any assets of the corporation\n\n          or any Subsidiary having an aggregate Fair Market Value\n\n          (as hereinafter defined) of $100,000,000 or more; or\n\n\n\n               (3)  the issuance or transfer by the corporation\n\n          or any Subsidiary (in one transaction or a series of\n\n          transactions) of any securities of the corporation or\n\n          any Subsidiary to any Interested Stockholder or any\n\n          Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder having an\n\n          aggregate Fair Market Value of $100,000,000 or more,\n\n          other than the issuance of securities upon the\n\n          conversion of convertible securities of the corporation\n\n          or any Subsidiary which were not acquired by such\n\n          Interested Stockholder (or such Affiliate) from the\n\n          corporation or a Subsidiary; or\n\n\n\n               (4)  the adoption of any plan or proposal for the\n\n          liquidation or dissolution of the corporation proposed\n\n          by or on behalf of any Interested Stockholder or any\n\n          Affiliate of any Interested Stockholder; or\n\n\n\n               (5)  any reclassification of securities (including\n\n          any reverse stock split), or recapitalization or\n\n          reorganization of the corporation, or any merger or\n\n          consolidation of the corporation with any of its\n\n          Subsidiaries, or any self tender offer for or\n\n          repurchase of securities of the corporation by the\n\n          corporation or any Subsidiary or any other transaction\n\n          (whether of not with or into or otherwise involving any\n\n          Interested Stockholder) which has the effect, directly\n\n          or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of\n\n          the outstanding shares of any class or series of equity\n\n          or convertible securities of the corporation or any\n\n          Subsidiary which is directly or indirectly owned by any\n\n          Interested Stockholder or any Affiliate of any\n\n          Interested Stockholder;\n\n\n\n     shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at\n\n     least (i) seventy-five per centum of the combined voting\n\n     power of the then issued and outstanding capital stock of\n\n     all classes and series of the corporation having voting\n\n     powers (the \"Voting Stock\"), voting together as a single\n\n     class, and (ii) a majority of the combined voting power of\n\n     the then issued and outstanding Voting Stock beneficially\n\n     owned by persons other than such Interested Stockholder,\n\n     voting together as a single class, given at any annual\n\n     meeting of stockholders or at any special meeting called for\n\n     that purpose.
