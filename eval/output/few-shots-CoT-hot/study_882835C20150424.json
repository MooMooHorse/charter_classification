Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall\n\n---------------------- be designated as \u0093Series A Preferred Stock\u0094 and the\n\nnumber of shares initially constituting such series shall be twenty five\n\nthousand (25,000); provided, however, that, if more than a total of twenty\n\nfive thousand (25,000) shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be issuable\n\nupon the exercise of the Rights (the \u0093Rights\u0094) issued pursuant to the Rights\n\nAgreement dated as of January 8, 1996 between the Corporation and SunTrust\n\nBank, Atlanta, as Rights Agent, the Board of Directors of the Corporation,\n\npursuant to Section 151(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of\n\nDelaware, shall direct by resolution or resolutions that a certificate be\n\nproperly executed, acknowledged, filed and recorded, in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of Section 103 thereof, providing for the total number of shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock authorized to be issued to be increased (to the\n\nextent the Certificate of Incorporation then permits) to the largest number of\n\nwhole shares (rounded up to the nearest whole number) issuable upon exercise\n\nof the Rights. Section 2. Dividends and Distributions.\n\n--------------------------- (A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of\n\nthe holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and\n\nsuperior to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,\n\nthe holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to\n\nreceive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds\n\nlegally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the\n\nlast day of each fiscal quarter in each year or on such dates as the Board of\n\nDirectors shall approve (each such date being referred to herein as a\n\n\u0093Quarterly Dividend Payment Date\u0094), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock\n\n(rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\ngreater of (i) $.01 or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment\n\nhereinafter set forth, one thousand (1,000) times the aggregate per share\n\namount of all cash dividends, and one thousand (1,000) times the aggregate per\n\nshare amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other\n\ndistributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a\n\nsubdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or\n\notherwise), declared on the Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the\n\nCorporation (the \u0093Common Stock\u0094) since the immediately preceding Quarterly\n\nDividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock. If the Corporation shall at any time after January\n\n8, 1996 (the \u0093Rights Dividend Declaration Date\u0094) (i) declare any dividend on\n\nCommon Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding\n\nCommon Stock into a larger number of shares, or (iii) combine the outstanding\n\nCommon Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the\n\namount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled\n\nimmediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence\n\nshall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of\n\nwhich is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after\n\nsuch event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common\n\nStock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) The\n\nCorporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred\n\nStock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a\n\ndividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in\n\nshares of Common Stock); provided that, if no dividend or distribution shall\n\nhave been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly\n\nDividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,\n\na dividend of $.01 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall\n\nnevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next\n\npreceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless\n\nthe date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first\n\nQuarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall\n\nbegin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of\n\nissue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date\n\nfor the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nentitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend\n\nPayment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue\n\nand be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but\n\nunpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such\n\ndividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated\n\npro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time\n\noutstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the\n\ndetermination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to\n\nreceive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record\n\ndate shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment\n\nthereof. Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A\n\n------------- Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights: (A)\n\nSubject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one thousand\n\n(1000) votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the\n\nCorporation. If the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend\n\nDeclaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of\n\nCommon Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock into a larger number\n\nof shares, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number\n\nof shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which\n\nholders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior\n\nto such\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nevent shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator\n\nof which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after\n\nsuch event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common\n\nStock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) Except as\n\notherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together\n\nas one class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the\n\nCorporation. (C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Preferred Stock\n\nshall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon,\n\nthe occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period\n\n(herein called a \u0093default period\u0094) which shall extend until such time when all\n\naccrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and\n\nfor the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for\n\npayment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including\n\nholders of the Series A Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an\n\namount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class,\n\nirrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two (2) Directors. (ii)\n\nDuring any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called\n\npursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting\n\nof shareholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of shareholders, provided\n\nthat neither such voting right nor the right of the holders of any other\n\nseries of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the\n\nauthorized number of Directors shall be exercised unless the holders of ten\n\npercent (10%) in number of shares of Preferred Stock\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\noutstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of\n\nthe holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of\n\nPreferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of\n\nPreferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing\n\ndefault period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect\n\nDirectors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may\n\nthen exist up to two (2) Directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual\n\nmeeting, to elect two (2) Directors. If the number which may be so elected at\n\nany special meeting does not amount to two (2) Directors, the holders of the\n\nPreferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of\n\nDirectors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the two (2)\n\nDirectors. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their\n\nright to elect Directors in any default period and during the continuance of\n\nsuch period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or decreased\n\nexcept by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or\n\npursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari\n\npassu with the Series A Preferred ---- ----- Stock. (iii) Unless the holders\n\nof Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously\n\nexercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or\n\nany shareholder or shareholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten\n\npercent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding,\n\nirrespective of series, may request, the calling of special meeting of the\n\nholders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the\n\nPresident, a Vice-President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of\n\nsuch meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are\n\nentitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph (C)(iii) shall be given to each\n\nholder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at\n\nhis last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such\n\nmeeting shall be called for a time not earlier than twenty (20) days and not\n\nlater than sixty (60) days after such order or request or in default of the\n\ncalling of such meeting within sixty (60) days after such order\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nor request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any shareholder or\n\nshareholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the\n\ntotal number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the\n\nprovisions of this paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called\n\nduring the period within sixty (60) days immediately preceding the date fixed\n\nfor the next annual meeting of the shareholders. (iv) In any default period,\n\nthe holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if\n\napplicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of\n\nDirectors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their\n\nright to elect two (2) Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of\n\nwhich right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock\n\nshall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by\n\nsuch holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any\n\nvacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in paragraph (C)(ii)\n\nof this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining Directors\n\ntheretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the\n\nDirector whose office shall have become vacant. References in this paragraph\n\n(C) to Directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall\n\ninclude Directors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in\n\nclause (y) of the foregoing sentence. (v) Immediately upon the expiration of a\n\ndefault period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to\n\nelect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the\n\nholders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of\n\nDirectors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Certificate of\n\nIncorporation or By-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the\n\nprovisions of paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject,\n\nhowever, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the\n\nCertificate of Incorporation or By-laws). Any vacancies in the Board of\n\nDirectors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\npreceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors,\n\neven though less than a quorum. (D) Except as set forth herein, holders of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent\n\nshall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with\n\nholders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.\n\nSection 4. Certain Restrictions. -------------------- (A) Whenever quarterly\n\ndividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until\n\nall accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared,\n\non shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in\n\nfull, the Corporation shall not (i) declare or pay dividends on, make any\n\nother distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for\n\nconsideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or\n\nupon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\n(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares\n\nof stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends\n\npaid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on\n\nwhich dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts\n\nto which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any\n\nstock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that\n\nthe corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares\n\nof any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the\n\nCorporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution,\n\nliquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or (iv) purchase\n\nor otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock,\n\nor any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock,\n\nexcept in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication\n\n(as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon\n\nsuch terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective\n\nannual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the\n\nrespective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in\n\nfair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to\n\npurchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the\n\nCorporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section\n\n4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.\n\nSection 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\n----------------- purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any\n\nmanner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the\n\nacquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become\n\nauthorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part\n\nof a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions\n\nof the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on\n\nissuance set forth herein. Section 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.\n\n-------------------------------------- (A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or\n\notherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution\n\nshall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to\n\ndividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock shall have received $10 per share, plus an amount equal to\n\naccrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not\n\ndeclared, to the date of such payment (the \u0093Series A Liquidation Preference\u0094).\n\nFollowing the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation\n\nPreference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of\n\nCommon Stock shall have received an amount per share (the \u0093Common Adjustment\u0094)\n\nequal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation\n\nPreference by (ii) one thousand (1000) (as appropriately adjusted as set forth\n\nin subparagraph C below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock\n\ndividends and recapitalizations with respect to the\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nCommon Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the \u0093Adjustment Number\u0094).

(B) In the event, however, that\n\nthere are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the\n\nSeries A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other\n\nseries of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to\n\nthe holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective\n\nliquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient\n\nassets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such\n\nremaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.\n\n(C) If the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration\n\nDate (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common\n\nStock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock into a larger number of\n\nshares, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of\n\nshares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately\n\nprior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by\n\na fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock\n\noutstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to\n\nsuch event. Section 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. If the Corporation shall\n\n--------------------------- enter into any consolidation, merger, combination\n\nor other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or\n\nchanged into other stock or\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nsecurities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or\n\nchanged in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment\n\nhereinafter set forth) equal to one thousand (1000) times the aggregate amount\n\nof stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the\n\ncase may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or\n\nexchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nafter the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common\n\nStock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common\n\nStock into a larger number of shares, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common\n\nStock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set\n\nforth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of\n\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such\n\namount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common\n\nStock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is\n\nthe number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior\n\nto such event. Section 8. No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock ------------- shall not be redeemable. Section 9. Ranking. The Series A\n\nPreferred Stock shall rank junior \\------- to all other series of the\n\nCorporation\u0092s Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the\n\ndistribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series shall provide\n\notherwise. Section 10. Amendment. The Certificate of Incorporation of the\n\n--------- Corporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would\n\nmaterially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the\n\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding\n\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSection 11.
