The initial Conversion Price for shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A Issue Price and the\n\ninitial Conversion Price for shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be the\n\nOriginal Series B Issue Price, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section\n\n4(d) hereof.\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n          (b)  Automatic Conversion.  Each share of Series A Preferred Stock and\n\n               --------------------\n\nSeries B Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common\n\nStock at the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such Series A Preferred\n\nStock immediately upon the earlier of (i)  this corporation's sale of its Common\n\nStock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to a\n\nregistration statement on Form S-1 or Form SB-2 under the Securities Act of\n\n1933, as amended, provided that the aggregate gross offering price is at least\n\n$25,000,000 or (ii) upon vote of the holders of a majority of the then\n\noutstanding shares of Preferred Stock (which provision may be amended only by a\n\nmajority vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock).\n\n\n\n          (c)  Mechanics of Conversion.  Before any holder of Preferred Stock\n\n               -----------------------\n\nshall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he or she\n\nshall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the\n\noffice of this corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, and\n\nshall give written notice to this corporation at its principal corporate office,\n\nof the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in\n\nwhich the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be\n\nissued.  This corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and\n\ndeliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or\n\nnominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares\n\nof Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid.  Such\n\nconversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of\n\nbusiness on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be\n\nconverted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common\n\nStock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the\n\nrecord holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock as of such date.  If the\n\nconversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities\n\nregistered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, the conversion may, at the\n\noption of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned\n\nupon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to\n\nsuch offering, in which event the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock\n\nupon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted\n\nsuch Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of\n\nsecurities.\n\n\n\n          (d)  Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain\n\n               -----------------------------------------------------------\n\nSplits and Combinations.

Except to the limited extent\n\nprovided for in subsections (E)(3) and (E)(4), no adjustment of such Conversion\n\nPrice pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing\n\nthe Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to\n\nsuch adjustment.\n\n\n\n                    (C)  In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash,\n\nthe consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before\n\ndeducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid\n\nor incurred by this corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection\n\nwith the issuance and sale thereof.\n\n\n\n                    (D)  In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a\n\nconsideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than\n\ncash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of\n\nDirectors as determined in good faith irrespective of any accounting treatment.\n\n\n\n                    (E)  In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or\n\nafter the applicable Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to\n\nsubscribe for

antidilution adjustments) of such options to\n\npurchase or rights to subscribe for Common Stock shall be deemed to have been\n\nissued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration\n\nequal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections\n\n4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)), if any, received by this corporation upon the\n\nissuance of such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in\n\nsuch options or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution\n\nadjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.\n\n\n\n

exchangeability, including, without\n\nlimitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential\n\nantidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible or exchangeable securities\n\nor upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such\n\nconvertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange\n\nthereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were\n\nissued or such options or rights\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nwere issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received\n\nby this corporation for any such securities and related options or rights\n\n(excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued\n\ndividends),

securities or the exercise\n\nof any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be\n\ndetermined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and (d)(i)(D)).\n\n\n\n                         (3)  In the event of any change in the number of shares\n\nof Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to this corporation\n\nupon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for\n\nsuch convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a\n\nchange resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof (unless such options\n\nor rights or convertible or exchangeable securities were merely deemed to be\n\nincluded in the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the number\n\nof shares of Common Stock outstanding for purposes of subsection 4(d)(i)(A)),\n\nthe Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way\n\naffected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be\n\nrecomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for\n\nthe actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon\n\nthe exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such\n\nsecurities.\n\n\n\n                         (4)  Upon the expiration of any such options or rights,\n\nthe termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of\n\nany options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities,\n\nthe Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way\n\naffected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or\n\nrights related to such securities (unless such options or rights were merely\n\ndeemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of\n\ndetermining the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for purposes of\n\nsubsection 4(d)(i)(A)), shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities\n\nthat remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or\n\nrights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise\n\nof the options or rights related to such securities.\n\n\n\n                         (5)  The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued\n\nand the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1)\n\nand (2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or\n\nexpiration of the type described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or (4).\n\n\n\n               (ii) \"Additional Stock\" shall mean any shares of Common Stock\n\nissued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to
