Procedures for Redemption.\n\n\n\n(a) If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nare to be redeemed pursuant to Section 5, the shares shall be redeemed on a\n\npro rata basis (according to the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nheld by each holder, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole\n\nshare) or in such other manner as the Board of Directors may determine, as may\n\nbe prescribed by resolution of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the\n\nprovisions of Section 5 and this Section 6, unless full cumulative cash\n\ndividends (whether or not declared) on all outstanding shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock shall have been paid or contemporaneously are declared and\n\npaid or set apart for payment for all Dividend Periods terminating on or prior\n\nto the applicable redemption date, none of the shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock shall be redeemed, and no sum shall be set aside for such redemption,\n\nunless shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemed pro rata.\n\n\n\n(b) In the event of a redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\npursuant to Section 5, notice of such redemption shall be given by first class\n\nmail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 15 days nor more than 60 days\n\nprior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of the shares to be\n\nredeemed at such holder\u0092s address as the same appears on the stock register of\n\nthe Corporation; provided that neither the failure to give such notice nor any\n\ndefect therein shall affect the validity of the giving of notice for the\n\nredemption of any share of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, except as\n\nto the holder to whom the Corporation has failed to give said notice or except\n\nas to the holder whose notice was defective. Each such notice shall state: (i)\n\nthe redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to\n\nbe redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be\n\nredeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the\n\nredemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares\n\nare to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that\n\ndividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption\n\ndate. Any notice mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively\n\npresumed to have been duly given whether or not the holder receives the\n\nnotice.\n\n\n\n(c) If a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to Section 6(b) and if,\n\non or before the redemption date, the funds necessary for such redemption\n\n(including all\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\ndividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed that will\n\naccrue to but not including the redemption date) shall have been set aside by\n\nthe Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the pro\n\nrata benefit of the holders of the shares so called for redemption, then on\n\nthe redemption date, notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares\n\nhave not been surrendered for cancellation, (i) dividends shall cease to\n\naccrue on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, (ii) the\n\nholders of such shares shall cease to be stockholders with respect to those\n\nshares, shall have no interest in or claims against the Corporation by virtue\n\nthereof and shall have no voting or other rights with respect thereto, except\n\nthe conversion rights provided in Section 7 (in accordance with Section 6(e))\n\nand the right to receive the monies payable upon such redemption, without\n\ninterest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement, if required by the\n\nCorporation) of their certificates, and (iii) the shares evidenced thereby\n\nshall no longer be outstanding. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any monies\n\nso set aside by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the\n\nredemption date shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation, after\n\nwhich reversion the holders of such shares so called for redemption shall look\n\nonly to the general funds of the Corporation for the payment of the redemption\n\nprice, without interest. Any interest accrued on funds so deposited shall\n\nbelong to the Corporation and be paid thereto from time to time.\n\n\n\n(d) Upon surrender in accordance with the Corporation\u0092s notice of redemption\n\nof the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned\n\nfor transfer, if the Board of Directors shall so require and the notice shall\n\nso state), such shares shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the redemption\n\nprice aforesaid. In case fewer than all the shares represented by any such\n\ncertificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the\n\nunredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof.\n\n\n\n(e) If a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to Section 6(b) and any\n\nholder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall, prior to the close of\n\nbusiness on the Business Day preceding the redemption date, give written\n\nnotice to the Corporation pursuant to Section 7 of the conversion of any or\n\nall of the shares to be redeemed held by the holder (accompanied by a\n\ncertificate or certificates for such shares, duly endorsed or assigned to the\n\nCorporation, and any necessary transfer tax payment, as required by Section\n\n7), then such redemption shall not become effective as to such shares to be\n\nconverted and such conversion shall become effective as provided in Section 7,\n\nwhereupon any funds deposited by the Corporation for the redemption of such\n\nshares shall (subject to any right of the holder of such shares to receive the\n\ndividend payable thereon as provided in Section 7) immediately upon such\n\nconversion be returned to the Corporation or, if then held in trust by the\n\nCorporation, shall automatically and without further corporate action or\n\nnotice be discharged from the trust.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n7. Conversion.\n\n\n\n(a) Right to Convert.\n\n\n\n(i) Subject to the provisions of this Section 7, each holder of shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock shall have the right, at any time and from time to\n\ntime, at such holder\u0092s option, to convert any or all of such holder\u0092s shares\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-\n\nassessable shares of Common Stock at the conversion price of $56.525 per share\n\nof Common Stock, subject to adjustment as described in Section 7(c) (as\n\nadjusted, the \u0093Conversion Price\u0094). The number of shares of Common Stock into\n\nwhich a share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible (calculated\n\nas to each conversion to the nearest 1/1,000,000th of a share) shall be\n\ndetermined by dividing $50.00 by the Conversion Price in effect at the time of\n\nconversion.\n\n\n\n(ii) If shares of Series A Preferred Stock are called for redemption in\n\naccordance with Section 5(a), the right to convert shares so called for\n\nredemption shall terminate at the close of business on the Business Day\n\nimmediately preceding the date fixed for redemption unless the Corporation\n\nshall default in making payment of the amount payable upon such redemption, in\n\nwhich case the conversion rights for such shares shall continue.\n\n\n\n(b) Mechanics of Conversion.\n\n\n\n(i) To exercise the conversion right, the holder of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock to be converted shall surrender the certificate or\n\ncertificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation (or any\n\ntransfer agent of the Corporation previously designated by the Corporation to\n\nthe holders of Series A Preferred Stock for this purpose) with a written\n\nnotice of election to convert completed and signed, specifying the number of\n\nshares to be converted. Unless the shares issuable upon conversion are to be\n\nissued in the same name as the name in which such shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock are registered, each share surrendered for conversion shall be\n\naccompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the\n\nCorporation, duly executed by the holder or the holder\u0092s duly authorized\n\nattorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax in\n\naccordance with Section 7(b)(vii). As promptly as practicable after the\n\nsurrender by the holder of the certificates for shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock as aforesaid, the Corporation shall issue and shall deliver to such\n\nholder, or on the holder\u0092s written order to the holder\u0092s transferee, a\n\ncertificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of Common Stock\n\nissuable upon the conversion of such shares and a check payable in an amount\n\ncorresponding to any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock as\n\nprovided in Section 7(b)(viii).\n\n\n\n(ii) Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior\n\nto the close of business on the first Business Day (the \u0093Conversion Date\u0094) on\n\nwhich the certificates for shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been\n\nsurrendered and such notice received by the Corporation as aforesaid. At such\n\ntime on the Conversion Date:\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(w) the person in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for\n\nshares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed\n\nto have become the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock represented\n\nthereby at such time;\n\n\n\n(x) such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be\n\noutstanding and all rights of a holder with respect to such shares surrendered\n\nfor conversion shall immediately terminate except the right to receive the\n\nCommon Stock and other amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7;\n\n\n\n(y) in lieu of dividends on such Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section\n\n3, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall participate equally and\n\nratably with the holders of shares of Common Stock in all dividends paid on\n\nthe Common Stock; and\n\n\n\n(z) the right of the Corporation to redeem such shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock shall terminate, regardless of whether a notice of redemption has been\n\nmailed as aforesaid.\n\n\n\nAll shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series A Preferred\n\nStock will, upon delivery, be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-\n\nassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any preemptive\n\nrights.\n\n\n\n(iii) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business\n\non a Dividend Payment Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend\n\npayable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date\n\nnotwithstanding the conversion thereof following such Dividend Payment Record\n\nDate and prior to such Dividend Payment Date. However, shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock surrendered for conversion during the period between the close\n\nof business on any Dividend Payment Record Date and the opening of business on\n\nthe corresponding Dividend Payment Date (except shares converted after the\n\nissuance of a notice of redemption during such period, which shall be entitled\n\nto such dividend on the Dividend Payment Date) must be accompanied by payment\n\nof an amount equal to the dividend payable on such shares on such Dividend\n\nPayment Date; provided that notwithstanding such surrender of shares for\n\nconversion after such Dividend Payment Record Date, the holders thereof at the\n\nclose of business on such Dividend Payment Record Date shall be entitled to\n\nreceive the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend\n\nPayment Date. A holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock on a Dividend\n\nPayment Record Date who (or whose transferee) tenders any such shares for\n\nconversion into shares of Common Stock on such Dividend Payment Date will\n\nreceive the dividend payable by the Corporation on such shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock on such date, and the converting holder need not include\n\npayment of the amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock for conversion.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(iv) Except as provided in clause (iii) above and in Section 7(c), the\n\nCorporation shall make no payment or adjustment for accrued and unpaid\n\ndividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock, whether or not in arrears, on\n\nconversion of such shares or for dividends in cash on the shares of Common\n\nStock issued upon such conversion.\n\n\n\n(v) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep\n\navailable, free from preemptive rights, such number of its authorized but\n\nunissued shares of Common Stock as shall be required for the purpose of\n\neffecting conversions of the Series A Preferred Stock. Prior to the delivery\n\nof any securities which the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon\n\nconversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall comply with\n\nall applicable federal and state laws and regulations which require action to\n\nbe taken by the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(vi) The Corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue\n\nor transfer taxes payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of shares of\n\nCommon Stock on conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant hereto;\n\nprovided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may\n\nbe payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of\n\nshares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder of the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock to be converted, and no such issuance or delivery shall be\n\nmade unless and until the person requesting such issuance or delivery has paid\n\nto the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the\n\nsatisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.\n\n\n\n(vii) In connection with the conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu\n\nthereof the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such\n\nfractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied\n\nby the Daily Price (as defined below) per share of Common Stock on the\n\nConversion Date. In the absence of a Daily Price, the Board of Directors shall\n\nin good faith determine the current market price on such basis as it considers\n\nappropriate, and such current market price shall be used to calculate the cash\n\nadjustment. As used herein, \u0093Daily Price\u0094 means (w) if the shares of such\n\nclass of Common Stock are then listed and traded on the New York Stock\n\nExchange, Inc. (\u0093NYSE\u0094), the closing price on such day as reported on the NYSE\n\nComposite Transactions Tape; (x) if the shares of such class of Common Stock\n\nare not then listed and traded on the NYSE, the closing price on such day as\n\nreported by the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are\n\nlisted and traded; (y) if the shares of such class of Common Stock are not\n\nthen listed and traded on any such securities exchange, the last reported sale\n\nprice on such day on the National Market of the National Association of\n\nSecurities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System (\u0093NASDAQ\u0094); or (z) if the\n\nshares of such class of Common Stock are not then traded on the NASDAQ\n\nNational Market, the average of the highest reported bid and lowest reported\n\nasked price on such day, as reported by NASDAQ.\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(c) Adjustments to Conversion Price.  The Conversion Price shall be adjusted\n\nfrom time to time as follows:\n\n\n\n(i) If, at any time after the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred\n\nStock, the Corporation shall (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution on any\n\nclass of its capital stock in shares of its Common Stock, (B) subdivide its\n\noutstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (C)\n\ncombine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of\n\nshares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be\n\nadjusted as provided below so that the Conversion Price thereafter shall be\n\ndetermined by multiplying the Conversion Price at which the shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock were theretofore convertible by a fraction, the numerator of\n\nwhich shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately\n\nprior to such action, and the denominator of which shall be the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following such action. Such\n\nadjustment shall be made whenever any event listed above shall occur and shall\n\nbecome effective retroactively immediately after the record date in the case\n\nof a dividend and immediately after the effective date in the case of a\n\nsubdivision or combination.\n\n\n\n(ii) If, at any time after the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred\n\nStock, the Corporation shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its\n\nCommon Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after the\n\nrecord date for determining stockholders entitled to receive such rights or\n\nwarrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per\n\nshare less than the current market price per share of Common Stock at the\n\nrecord date therefor (as determined in accordance with the provisions of\n\nSection 7(c)(iv)), the \u0093Current Market Price\u0094), or in case the Corporation\n\nshall issue to all holders of its Common Stock other securities convertible\n\ninto or exchangeable for Common Stock for a consideration per share of Common\n\nStock deliverable upon conversion or exchange thereof less than the Current\n\nMarket Price, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto\n\nshall be adjusted as provided below so that the Conversion Price therefor\n\nshall be equal to the price determined by multiplying (A) the Conversion Price\n\nat which shares of Series A Preferred Stock were theretofore convertible by\n\n(B) a fraction of which the numerator shall be the sum of (1) the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of the convertible\n\nor exchangeable securities, rights or warrants and (2) the number of\n\nadditional shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price for the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock so offered would purchase at the Current\n\nMarket Price per share of Common Stock, and of which the denominator shall be\n\nthe sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of\n\nissuance of such convertible or exchangeable securities, rights or warrants\n\nand (2) the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for\n\nsubscription or purchase, or issuable upon such conversion or exchange. Such\n\nadjustment shall be made whenever such convertible or exchangeable securities,\n\nrights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after\n\nthe record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nreceive such securities. However, upon the expiration of any right or warrant\n\nto purchase Common Stock, the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment in\n\nthe Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 7(c)(ii), if any such right or\n\nwarrant shall expire and shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price\n\nshall be recomputed immediately upon such expiration and effective immediately\n\nupon such expiration shall be increased to the price it would have been (but\n\nreflecting any other adjustments to the Conversion Price made pursuant to the\n\nprovisions of this Section 7(c) after the issuance of such rights or warrants)\n\nhad the adjustment of the Conversion Price made upon the issuance of such\n\nrights or warrants been made on the basis of offering for subscription or\n\npurchase only that number of shares of Common Stock actually purchased upon\n\nthe exercise of such rights or warrants. No further adjustment shall be made\n\nupon exercise of any right, warrant, convertible security or exchangeable\n\nsecurity if any adjustment shall have been made upon issuance of such\n\nsecurity.\n\n\n\n(iii) If, at any time after the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred\n\nStock, the Corporation shall distribute to all holders of its Common Stock\n\n(including any dividend paid in connection with a consolidation or merger in\n\nwhich the Corporation is the continuing corporation) any shares of capital\n\nstock of the Corporation or its subsidiaries (other than Common Stock) or\n\nevidences of its indebtedness, cash or other assets (excluding dividends\n\npayable solely in cash that may from time to time be fixed by the Board of\n\nDirectors, or dividends or distributions in connection with the liquidation,\n\ndissolution or winding up of the Corporation) or rights or warrants to\n\nsubscribe for or purchase any of its securities or those of its subsidiaries\n\nor securities convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock (excluding those\n\nsecurities referred to in Section 7(c)(ii)), then in each such case the\n\nConversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted as\n\nprovided below so that the Conversion Price thereafter shall be equal to the\n\nprice determined by multiplying (A) the Conversion Price in effect on the\n\nrecord date mentioned below by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be\n\nthe Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date\n\nmentioned below less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of\n\nDirectors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive) as of such\n\nrecord date of the assets, evidences of indebtedness or securities so paid\n\nwith respect to one share of Common Stock, and the denominator of which shall\n\nbe the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on such record date;\n\nprovided, however, that in the event the then fair market value (as so\n\ndetermined) so paid with respect to one share of Common Stock is equal to or\n\ngreater than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record\n\ndate mentioned above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision\n\nshall be made so that each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall\n\nhave the right to receive the amount and kind of assets, evidences of\n\nindebtedness, or securities such holder would have received had such holder\n\nconverted each such share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the\n\nrecord date for such dividend. Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such\n\npayment is made, and shall become\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\neffective retroactively immediately after the record date for the\n\ndetermination of stockholders entitled to receive the payment.\n\n\n\n(iv) For the purpose of any computation under Sections 7(c)(ii) or 7(c)(iii),\n\nthe Current Market Price per share of Common Stock at any date shall be deemed\n\nto be the average Daily Price for the 30 consecutive trading days commencing\n\n35 trading days before the day in question.\n\n\n\n(v) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless the\n\nadjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the\n\nConversion Price then in effect; provided, however, that any adjustments that\n\nby reason of this Section 7(c)(v) are not required to be made shall be carried\n\nforward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations\n\nunder this Section 7(c) shall be made to the nearest cent.\n\n\n\n(vi) In the event that, at any time as a result of an adjustment made pursuant\n\nto Section 7(c)(i) or 7(c)(iii), the holder of any shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to\n\nreceive any shares of the Corporation or its subsidiaries, other than shares\n\nof the Common Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable\n\nupon conversion of any share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to\n\nadjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as\n\npracticable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock contained in\n\nSections 7(c)(i) through 7(c)(v), and the other provisions of this Section 7\n\nwith respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other\n\nshares.\n\n\n\n(vii) Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted, as herein provided, the\n\nCorporation shall promptly file with the transfer agent for the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock a certificate of an officer of the Corporation setting forth\n\nthe Conversion Price after the adjustment and setting forth a brief statement\n\nof the facts requiring such adjustment and a computation thereof. The\n\ncertificate shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the\n\nadjustment. The Corporation shall promptly cause a notice of the adjusted\n\nConversion Price to be mailed to each registered holder of shares of Series A\n\nPreferred Stock.\n\n\n\n(viii) In case of any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation\n\nof the Corporation with, or merger of the Corporation into, any other entity,\n\nany merger of another entity into the Corporation (other than a merger that\n\ndoes not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation\n\nof outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation), any sale or\n\ntransfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any\n\ncompulsory share exchange pursuant to which share exchange the Common Stock is\n\nconverted into other securities, cash or other property, then lawful provision\n\nshall be made as part of the terms of such transaction whereby the holder of\n\neach share of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right\n\nthereafter, during the period such share\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nshall be convertible, to convert such share only into the kind and amount of\n\nsecurities, cash and other property receivable upon the reclassification,\n\nconsolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange by a holder of the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which a share of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock would have been convertible immediately prior to the\n\nreclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange. The\n\nCorporation, the person formed by the consolidation or resulting from the\n\nmerger or which acquires such assets or which acquires the Corporation\u0092s\n\nshares, as the case may be, shall make provisions in its certificate or\n\narticles of incorporation or other constituent documents to establish such\n\nrights and to ensure that the dividend, voting and other rights of the holders\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock established herein are unchanged, except as\n\npermitted by Section 9 and applicable law. The certificate or articles of\n\nincorporation or other constituent documents shall provide for adjustments,\n\nwhich, for events subsequent to the effective date of the certificate or\n\narticles of incorporation or other constituent documents, shall be as nearly\n\nequivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this\n\nSection 7. The provisions of this Section 7(c)(viii) shall similarly apply to\n\nsuccessive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or\n\nshare exchanges.\n\n\n\n(d) Optional Reduction in Conversion Price. The Corporation may at its option\n\nreduce the Conversion Price from time to time by any amount for any period of\n\ntime if the period is at least 20 days and if the reduction is irrevocable\n\nduring the period. Whenever the Conversion Price is so reduced, the\n\nCorporation shall mail to holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock a\n\nnotice of the reduction at least 15 days before the date the reduced\n\nConversion Price takes effect, stating the reduced Conversion Price and the\n\nperiod it will be in effect. A voluntary reduction of the Conversion Price\n\ndoes not change or adjust the Conversion Price otherwise in effect for\n\npurposes of Section 7(c).\n\n\n\n8. Status of Shares. All shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are at any time redeemed pursuant to Section 5 or converted pursuant to Section 7 and all shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are otherwise reacquired by the Corporation shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware) have the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, subject to reissuance by the Board of Directors as shares of any one or more other series.\n\n\n\n9. Voting Rights.\n\n\n\n(a) The holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be\n\nentitled to any voting rights except as hereinafter provided in this Section 9\n\nor as otherwise provided by law.\n\n\n\n(b) The holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (i) shall be\n\nentitled to vote with the holders of the Common Stock on all matters submitted\n\nfor a vote of holders of Common Stock (voting together with the holders of\n\nCommon Stock as one class), (ii) shall be entitled to a number of votes equal\n\nto the number of votes to which shares of Common\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nStock issuable upon conversion of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nwould have been entitled if such shares of Common Stock had been outstanding\n\nat the time of the applicable vote and related record date and (iii) shall be\n\nentitled to notice of any stockholders\u0092 meeting in accordance with the\n\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n(c) If and whenever six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive)\n\npayable on the Series A Preferred Stock have not been paid in full or if the\n\nCorporation shall have failed to discharge its Mandatory Redemption Obligation\n\non or after the Redemption Date, the number of directors then constituting the\n\nBoard of Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of shares of\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock, together with the holders of shares of every other\n\nseries of preferred stock upon which like rights to vote for the election of\n\ntwo additional directors have been conferred and are exercisable (resulting\n\nfrom either the failure to pay dividends or the failure to redeem) (any such\n\nother series is referred to as the \u0093Preferred Shares\u0094), voting as a single\n\nclass regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect the two additional\n\ndirectors to serve on the Board of Directors at any annual meeting of\n\nstockholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting\n\nof the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares called\n\nas hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the Series A\n\nPreferred Stock and the Preferred Shares then outstanding shall have been paid\n\nand dividends thereon for the current quarterly dividend period shall have\n\nbeen paid or declared and set apart for payment, or the Corporation shall have\n\nfulfilled its Mandatory Redemption Obligation, as the case may be, then the\n\nright of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares\n\nto elect such additional two directors shall cease (but subject always to the\n\nsame provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any\n\nsimilar future arrearages in six quarterly dividends or failure to fulfill any\n\nMandatory Redemption Obligation), and the terms of office of all persons\n\nelected as directors by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the\n\nPreferred Shares shall forthwith terminate and the number of the Board of\n\nDirectors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power\n\nshall have been so vested in the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nand the Preferred Shares, the secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the\n\nwritten request of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock (addressed to the\n\nsecretary at the principal office of the Corporation) shall, call a special\n\nmeeting of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and of the Preferred\n\nShares for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as herein\n\nprovided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the\n\nBylaws of the Corporation for a special meeting of the stockholders or as\n\nrequired by law. If any such special meeting required to be called as above\n\nprovided shall not be called by the secretary within 20 days after receipt of\n\nany such request, then any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock may\n\ncall such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for that purpose shall\n\nhave access to the stock records of the Corporation. The directors elected at\n\nany such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of\n\nthe stockholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof if such office shall\n\nnot have previously terminated as above provided. If any vacancy shall occur\n\namong the directors elected by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and\n\nthe Preferred Shares, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Directors,\n\nupon the nomination of the then-remaining director elected by the holders of\n\nthe Series A Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares or the successor of such\n\nremaining director, to serve until the next annual meeting of\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nthe stockholders or special meeting held in place thereof if such office shall\n\nnot have previously terminated as provided above.\n\n\n\n(d) So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding:\n\n\n\n(i) the Corporation shall not, without the written consent or affirmative vote\n\nat a meeting called for that purpose by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the\n\noutstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a single class,\n\namend, alter or repeal any provision of the Corporation\u0092s Certificate of\n\nIncorporation (by merger or otherwise) so as to materially and adversely\n\naffect the preferences, rights or powers of the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\nprovided that any such amendment, alteration or repeal to create, authorize or\n\nissue any Junior Securities or Parity Securities, or any security convertible\n\ninto, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of Junior Securities or\n\nParity Securities, shall not be deemed to have any such material adverse\n\neffect;\n\n\n\n(ii) the Corporation shall not, without the written consent or affirmative\n\nvote at a meeting called for that purpose of at least 66-2/3% of the votes\n\nentitled to be cast by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and\n\nof all other series of Preferred Stock upon which like rights to vote upon the\n\nmatters specified herein have been conferred and are exercisable, voting as a\n\nsingle class regardless of series, create, authorize or issue any Senior\n\nSecurities, or any security convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable\n\nfor, shares of Senior Securities; and\n\n\n\n(iii) the Corporation shall not, without the written consent or affirmative\n\nvote at a meeting called for that purpose of at least a majority of the votes\n\nentitled to be cast by the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and\n\nof all other series of Preferred Stock upon which like rights to vote upon the\n\nmatters specified herein have been conferred and are exercisable, voting as a\n\nsingle class regardless of series, create, authorize or issue any new class of\n\nParity Securities; provided that this clause (iii) shall not limit the right\n\nof the Corporation to issue Parity Securities in connection with any merger in\n\nwhich the Corporation is the surviving entity;\n\n\n\nprovided that no such consent or vote of the holders of Series A Preferred\n\nStock shall be required if at or prior to the time when such amendment,\n\nalteration or repeal is to take effect, or when the issuance of any such\n\nsecurities is to be made, as the case may be, all shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock at the time outstanding shall have been called for redemption by the\n\nCorporation and the funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set\n\naside in accordance with Sections 5 and 6.\n\n\n\n(e) The consent or votes required in Sections 9(c) and 9(d) shall be in\n\naddition to any approval of stockholders of the Corporation which may be\n\nrequired by law or pursuant to any provision of the Corporation\u0092s Certificate\n\nof Incorporation or Bylaws, which approval shall be obtained by vote of the\n\nstockholders of the Corporation in the manner provided in Section 9(b).\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n10.
