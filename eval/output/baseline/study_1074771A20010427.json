For the purposes of this\n\n     paragraph D only, if at the time when any such amendment, addition,\n\n     alteration, change or repeal is under consideration there is no proposed\n\n     Business Combination, the term \"Continuing Directors\" shall mean the Entire\n\n     Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n     THIRTEENTH: The Board of Directors, each committee of the Board of\n\nDirectors and each individual director, in discharging their respective duties\n\nunder applicable law and this Certificate of Incorporation and in determining\n\nwhat they each believe to be in the best interests of the Corporation and its\n\nstockholders, may consider the effects, both short-term and long-term, of any\n\naction or proposed action taken or to be taken by the Corporation, the Board of\n\nDirectors or any committee of the Board of Directors on the interests of (i) the\n\nemployees, associates, associated physicians, distributors, patients or other\n\ncustomers, suppliers or creditors of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and\n\n(ii) the communities in which the Corporation and its subsidiaries own or lease\n\nproperty or conduct business, all to the extent that the Board of Directors, any\n\ncommittee of the Board of Directors or any individual director deems pertinent\n\nunder the circumstances (including the possibility that the interests of the\n\nCorporation may best be served by the continued independence of the\n\nCorporation); provided, however, that the provisions of this Article Thirteenth\n\nshall not limit in any way the right of the Board of Directors to consider any\n\nother lawful factors in making its determinations, including, without\n\nlimitation, the effects, both short-term and long-term, of any action or\n\nproposed action on the Corporation or its stockholders directly; and provided\n\nfurther, that this Article Thirteenth shall be deemed solely to grant\n\ndiscretionary authority to the Board of Directors, each committee of the Board\n\nof Directors and each individual director and shall not be deemed to provide to\n\nany specific constituency any right to be considered.\n\n\n\n     FOURTEENTH: Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be\n\nmade a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in\n\nan actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,\n\nadministrative or investigative (hereinafter a \"proceeding\"), by reason of the\n\nfact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the\n\nCorporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a\n\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership,\n\njoint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an\n\nemployee benefit plan (hereinafter an \"Indemnitee\"), whether the basis of such\n\nproceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,\n\nemployee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as such a director,\n\nofficer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the\n\nCorporation to the full extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation\n\nLaw, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any\n\nsuch amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation\n\nto provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the\n\nCorporation to provide prior to such amendment), or by other applicable law as\n\nthen in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys'\n\nfees, judgments, fines, excise taxes under the Employee Retirement Income\n\nSecurity Act of 1974, as amended from time to time (\"ERISA\"), penalties and\n\namounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered\n\nby such Indemnitee in connection therewith.\n\n\n\n          A.   Procedure. Any indemnification under this Article Fourteenth\n\n     (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as\n\n     authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification\n\n     of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met\n\n     the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General\n\n     Corporation Law, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended (but, in\n\n     the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment\n\n     permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said\n\n     law permitted the\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n     Corporation to provide prior to such amendment). Such determination shall\n\n     be made (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum\n\n     consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or\n\n     proceeding (the \"Disinterested Directors\"), or (b) if such a quorum of\n\n     Disinterested Directors is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum\n\n     of Disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a\n\n     written opinion, or (c) by the stockholders.\n\n\n\n          B.   Advances For Expenses. Costs, charges and expenses (including\n\n     attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in\n\n     defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by\n\n     the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or\n\n     proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director\n\n     or officer to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall\n\n     ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to\n\n     be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article Fourteenth.\n\n     Such costs, charges and expenses incurred by other employees and agents may\n\n     be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the majority of the\n\n     Disinterested Directors deems appropriate. The majority of the\n\n     Disinterested Directors may, in the manner set forth above, and upon\n\n     approval of such Indemnitee, authorize the Corporation's counsel to\n\n     represent such person, in any action, suit or proceeding, whether or not\n\n     the Corporation is a party to such action, suit or proceeding.\n\n\n\n          C.   Procedure for Indemnification. Any indemnification or advance of\n\n     costs, charges and expenses under this Article Fourteenth, shall be made\n\n     promptly, and in any event within 60 days upon the written request of the\n\n     Indemnitee. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this\n\n     Article Fourteenth, shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of\n\n     competent jurisdiction, if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or\n\n     in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within 60 days. Such\n\n     Indemnitee's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully\n\n     establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in\n\n     any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a\n\n     defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim\n\n     for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under this Article\n\n     Fourteenth, where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by\n\n     the Corporation) that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct\n\n     set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or\n\n     hereafter may be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to\n\n     the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader\n\n     indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide\n\n     prior to such amendment), but the burden of proving such defense shall be\n\n     on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its\n\n     Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel and its stockholders) to\n\n     have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that\n\n     indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he\n\n     or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware\n\n     General Corporation Law, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended\n\n     (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such\n\n     amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights\n\n     that said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such\n\n     amendment), nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the\n\n     Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal\n\n     counsel and its stockholders) that the\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n     Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a\n\n     defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not\n\n     met the applicable standard of conduct.\n\n\n\n          D.   Other Rights; Continuation of Right to Indemnification. The\n\n     indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article\n\n     Fourteenth shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a\n\n     person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled\n\n     under any law, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested\n\n     directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity\n\n     and as to action in another capacity while holding office or while employed\n\n     by or acting as agent for the Corporation, and shall continue as to a\n\n     person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent, and\n\n     shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and\n\n     administrators of such person. All rights to indemnification under this\n\n     Article Fourteenth, shall be deemed to be a contract between the\n\n     Corporation and each director, officer, employee or agent of the\n\n     Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this\n\n     Article Fourteenth, is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this\n\n     Article Fourteenth, or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of\n\n     the Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable laws shall not\n\n     in any way diminish any rights to indemnification of such director,\n\n     officer, employee or agent or the obligations of the Corporation arising\n\n     hereunder with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of, or\n\n     relating to, any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the\n\n     final adoption of such modification or repeal. For the purposes of this\n\n     Article Fourteenth, references to \"the Corporation\" include all constituent\n\n     corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting\n\n     or surviving corporation, so that any person who is or was a director,\n\n     officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was\n\n     serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,\n\n     officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint\n\n     venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under\n\n     the provisions of this Article Fourteenth, with respect to the resulting or\n\n     surviving corporation, as he would if he or she had served the resulting or\n\n     surviving corporation in the same capacity.\n\n\n\n          E.   Insurance. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and\n\n     maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to\n\n     become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or\n\n     was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,\n\n     employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust\n\n     or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and\n\n     incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in any such capacity, or\n\n     arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation\n\n     would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under\n\n     the provisions of this Article Fourteenth; provided, however, that such\n\n     insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be\n\n     made by a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n          F.   Savings Clause. If this Article Fourteenth, or any portion hereof\n\n     shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction,\n\n     then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each person entitled to\n\n     indemnification under paragraph A of this Article Fourteenth, as to all\n\n     expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,\n\n     ERISA excise taxes, penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement)\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n     actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which\n\n     indemnification is available to such person pursuant to this Article\n\n     Fourteenth, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this\n\n     Article Fourteenth, that shall not have been invalidated and to the full\n\n     extent permitted by applicable law.\n\n\n\n     FIFTEENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by\n\nlaw or in this Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors (and any\n\ncommittee of the Board of Directors) is expressly authorized, to the extent\n\npermitted by law, to take such action or actions as the Board of Directors or\n\nsuch committee may determine to be reasonably necessary or desirable to (A)\n\nencourage any person to enter into negotiations with the Board of Directors and\n\nmanagement of the Corporation with respect to any transaction which may result\n\nin a change in control of the Corporation which is proposed or initiated by such\n\nperson or (B) contest or oppose any such transaction which the Board of\n\nDirectors or such committee determines to be unfair, abusive or otherwise\n\nundesirable with respect to the Corporation and its business, assets or\n\nproperties or the stockholders of the Corporation, including, without\n\nlimitation, the adoption of such plans or the issuance of such rights, options,\n\ncapital stock, notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness or other\n\nsecurities of the Corporation, which rights, options, capital stock, notes,\n\ndebentures, evidences of indebtedness and other securities (i) may be\n\nexchangeable for or convertible into cash or other securities on such terms and\n\nconditions as may be determined by the Board of Directors or such committee and\n\n(ii) may provide for the treatment of any holder or class of holders thereof\n\ndesignated by the Board of Directors or any such committee in respect of the\n\nterms, conditions, provisions and rights of such securities which is different\n\nfrom, and unequal to, the terms, conditions, provisions and rights applicable to\n\nall other holders thereof.\n\n\n\n     SIXTEENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or\n\nrepeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and to add\n\nor adopt new provisions, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute,\n\nand all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this\n\nreservation.
