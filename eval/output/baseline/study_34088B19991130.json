An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9(A) shall be given\n\neffect, upon payment of such a dividend or distribution, as of the record date\n\nfor the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or\n\ndistribution (on a retroactive basis) and in the case of a subdivision or\n\ncombination shall become effective immediately as of the effective date thereof.\n\n\n\n          (B) In the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to\n\ntime while any shares of Class A Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue rights,\n\noptions or warrants to all holders of its outstanding Common Stock, without any\n\ncharge to such holders, entitling them (for a period expiring within forty-five\n\n(45) days after the record date mentioned below) to subscribe for or purchase\n\nshares of Common Stock at a price per share which is more than 2% lower at the\n\nrecord date mentioned below than the then Current Market Price per share of\n\nCommon Stock, the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately prior to such action\n\nshall, subject to paragraphs (D) and (E) of this Section 9, be adjusted by\n\nmultiplying such Conversion Ratio by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall\n\nbe the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of\n\nsuch rights, options or warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common\n\nStock issued upon exercise thereof, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be\n\nthe number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such\n\nrights, options or warrants plus the number of shares which the aggregate\n\noffering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued would\n\npurchase at the then Current Market Price per share of Common Stock.  Such\n\nadjustment shall be made whenever such rights, options or warrants have expired,\n\nand shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for\n\nthe determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, options or\n\nwarrants on the basis of the number of rights, options or warrants actually\n\nexercised.\n\n\n\n          (C) In the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to\n\ntime while any of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock are outstanding, make an\n\nExtraordinary Distribution (as defined in Section 9(F)(ii)) in respect of the\n\nCommon Stock, whether by dividend, distribution, reclassification of shares or\n\nrecapitalization of the Corporation (other than a recapitalization or\n\nreclassification effected by a merger, combination or consolidation to which\n\nSection 8 hereof applies), the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately prior to\n\nsuch Extraordinary Distribution shall, subject to paragraphs (D) and (E) of this\n\nSection 9, be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Ratio by a fraction, the\n\nnumerator of which shall be the product of (i) the number of shares of Common\n\nStock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution and (ii)\n\nthe Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Valuation Date (as\n\ndefined in Section 9(F)(vi)) with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution, and\n\nthe\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\ndenominator of which shall be (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of\n\nCommon Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution and\n\n(y) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Valuation Date with\n\nrespect to an Extraordinary Distribution, minus (ii) the Fair Market Value of\n\n                                          -----\n\nthe Extraordinary Distribution on the Valuation Date.

When dividends are not paid in full, as\n\naforesaid, upon the shares of Class B Preferred Stock and any other shares\n\nranking, as to dividends, on a parity with Class B Preferred Stock, all\n\ndividends declared upon shares of Class B Preferred Stock shall be declared pro\n\nrata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on Class B Preferred\n\nStock and such other parity shares shall in all cases bear to each other the\n\nsame ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of Class B\n\nPreferred Stock and such other parity shares bear to each other.

On\n\nand after the effective date of conversion, the person or persons entitled to\n\nreceive Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all\n\npurposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock, but no\n\nallowance or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders\n\nof Common Stock of record on any date prior to such effective date.  The\n\nCorporation shall not be obligated to pay any dividends which shall have been\n\ndeclared and shall be payable to holders of shares of Class B Preferred Stock on\n\na Dividend Payment Date if such Dividend Payment Date for such dividend shall be\n\non or subsequent to the effective date of conversion of such shares.\n\n\n\n          (E)  The Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver to holders of\n\nClass B Preferred Stock any fractional share or shares of Common Stock issuable\n\nupon any conversion of such shares of Class B Preferred Stock, but in lieu\n\nthereof may make a cash payment in respect thereof in any manner permitted by\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\n          (F)  The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out\n\nof its authorized and unissued Common Stock or treasury Common Stock, solely for\n\nissuance upon the conversion of shares of Class B Preferred Stock as herein\n\nprovided, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be\n\nissuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Class B Preferred Stock then\n\noutstanding.\n\n\n\n     6.

If subsequently the Board of Directors is able to give full effect to\n\nthe Special Dividend as provided in Section 9(C)(1), then such Special Dividend\n\nwill be declared and other adjustments will be made in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of Section 9(C)(1) and the adjustment in the Conversion Price as\n\nprovided in this Section 9(C)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified\n\nprospectively.\n\n\n\n          (D)(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(E), in the event the\n\nCorporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of\n\nClass B Preferred Stock are outstanding, make an Extraordinary Distribution (as\n\ndefined in Section 9(G)(1) hereof) in respect of the Common Stock, whether by\n\ndividend, distribution, reclassification of shares or recapitalization of the\n\nCorporation (including capitalization or reclassification effected by a merger\n\nor consolidation to which Section 8 hereof does not apply) or effect a Pro Rata\n\nRepurchase (as defined in Section 9(G)(4) hereof) of Common Stock, then, in such\n\nevent, the Board of Directors shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare\n\na Special Dividend in such a manner that a holder of Class B Preferred Stock\n\nwill become a holder of that number of shares of Class B Preferred Stock equal\n\nto the product of the number of such shares held prior to such event times a\n\nfraction (the \"Sec. 9(D) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction\"), the numerator of which\n\nis the product of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding\n\nimmediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase minus,\n\nin the case of a Pro Rata Repurchase, the number of shares of Common Stock\n\nrepurchased by the Corporation multiplied by (b) the Fair Market Value of a\n\nshare of Common Stock on the day before the ex-dividend date with respect to an\n\nExtraordinary Distribution which is paid in cash and on the distribution date\n\nwith respect to an Extraordinary Distribution which is paid other than in cash,\n\nor on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any\n\ntender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase or on the date of purchase with\n\nrespect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a\n\n\n\n                                      35\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\ntender offer, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is (i) the\n\nproduct of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately\n\nbefore such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase multiplied by (y)\n\nthe Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the day before the ex-\n\ndividend date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution which is paid in\n\ncash and on the distribution date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution\n\nwhich is paid other than in cash, or on the applicable expiration date\n\n(including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata\n\nRepurchase, or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase\n\nwhich is not a tender offer, as the case may be, minus (ii) the Fair Market\n\nValue of the Extraordinary Distribution or the aggregate purchase price of the\n\nPro Rata Repurchase, as the case may be.  The Corporation shall send each holder\n\nof Class B Preferred Stock (i) notice of its intent to make an Extraordinary\n\nDistribution and (ii) notice of any offer by the Corporation to make a Pro Rata\n\nRepurchase, in each case at the same time as, or as soon as practicable after,\n\nsuch offer is first communicated to holders of Common Stock or, in the case of\n\nan Extraordinary Distribution, the announcement of a record date in accordance\n\nwith the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or\n\nadmitted to trading.  Such notice shall indicate the intended record date and\n\nthe amount and nature of such dividend or distribution, or the number of shares\n\nsubject to such offer for a Pro Rata Repurchase and the purchase price payable\n\nby the Corporation pursuant to such offer, as well as the Conversion Price and\n\nthe number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Class B Preferred\n\nStock may be converted at such time.  Concurrently with the Special Dividend\n\npaid pursuant to this Section 9(D)(1), the Conversion Price, the Liquidation\n\nPrice and the Regular Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Class B Preferred\n\nStock shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price\n\nand the Regular Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately\n\nbefore such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Sec. 9(D)\n\nNon-Dilutive Share Fraction determined pursuant to this Section 9(D)(1).\n\n\n\n          (2) The Corporation and the Board of Directors shall each use its best\n\nefforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are reasonably\n\nnecessary or appropriate for declaration of the Special Dividend provided in\n\nSection 9(D)(1) but shall not be required to call a special meeting of\n\nshareholders in order to implement the provisions thereof.  If for any reason\n\nthe Board of Directors is precluded from giving full effect to the Special\n\nDividend provided in Section 9(D)(1), then no such Special Dividend shall be\n\ndeclared, but instead the Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by\n\ndividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately before the event by the Sec.\n\n9(D) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction, and the Liquidation Price and the Regular\n\nPreferred Dividend Rate will not be adjusted.  If subsequently the Board of\n\nDirectors is able to give full effect to the Special Dividend as provided in\n\nSection 9(D)(1), then such Special Dividend will be declared and other\n\nadjustments will be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(D)(1)\n\nand the adjustment in the Conversion Price as provided in this Section 9(D)(2)\n\nwill automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively.\n\n\n\n          (E) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9, the\n\nCorporation shall not be required to make (i) any Special Dividend or any\n\nadjustment of the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price or the Regular\n\nPreferred Dividend Rate unless such adjustment would require an increase or\n\ndecrease of at least one percent (1%) in the number of shares of Class B\n\nPreferred Stock outstanding, or, (ii) if no additional shares of Class B\n\nPreferred Stock are issued, any adjustment of the Conversion Price unless such\n\nadjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in\n\nthe Conversion Price.  Any lesser adjustment\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nshall be carried forward and shall be made no later than the time of, and\n\ntogether with, the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any\n\nadjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or\n\ndecrease of at least one percent (1%) of the number of shares of Class B\n\nPreferred Stock outstanding or, if no additional shares of Class B Preferred\n\nStock are being issued, an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of\n\nthe Conversion Price, whichever the case may be.\n\n\n\n          (F) If the Corporation shall make any dividend or distribution on the\n\nCommon Stock or issue any Common Stock, other capital stock or other security of\n\nthe Corporation or any rights or warrants to purchase or acquire any such\n\nsecurity, which transaction does not result in an adjustment to the number of\n\nshares of Class B Preferred Stock outstanding or the Conversion Price pursuant\n\nto the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, the Board of Directors of the\n\nCorporation may, in its sole discretion, consider whether such action is of such\n\na nature that some type of equitable adjustment should be made in respect of\n\nsuch transaction.  If in such case the Board of Directors of the Corporation\n\ndetermines that some type of adjustment should be made, an adjustment shall be\n\nmade effective as of such date as determined by the Board of Directors of the\n\nCorporation.  The determination of the Board of Directors of the Corporation as\n\nto whether some type of adjustment should be made pursuant to the foregoing\n\nprovisions of this Section 9(F), and, if so, as to what adjustment should be\n\nmade and when, shall be final and binding on the Corporation and all\n\nshareholders of the Corporation.  The Corporation shall be entitled to make such\n\nadditional adjustments, in addition to those required by the foregoing\n\nprovisions of this Section 9, as shall be necessary in order that any dividend\n\nor distribution in shares of capital stock of the Corporation, subdivision,\n\nreclassification or combination of shares of the Corporation or any\n\nrecapitalization of the Corporation shall not be taxable to holders of the\n\nCommon Stock.\n\n\n\n          (G) For purposes hereof, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n\n\n          (1) \"Extraordinary Distribution\" shall mean any dividend or other\n\ndistribution to holders of Common Stock effected while any of the shares of\n\nClass B Preferred Stock are outstanding of (i) cash or (ii) any shares of\n\ncapital stock of the Corporation (other than shares of Common Stock), other\n\nsecurities of the Corporation (other than securities of the type referred to in\n\nSection 9(B)), evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or any other person\n\nor any other property (including shares of any subsidiary of the Corporation),\n\nor any combination thereof, where the aggregate amount of such cash dividend or\n\nother distribution together with the amount of all cash dividends and other\n\ndistributions made during the preceding period of twelve (12) months, when\n\ncombined with the aggregate amount of all Pro Rata Repurchases (for this\n\npurpose, including only that portion of the aggregate purchase price of such Pro\n\nRata Repurchase which is in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock\n\nrepurchased as determined on the applicable expiration date (including all\n\nextensions thereof) of any tender offer or exchange offer which is a Pro Rata\n\nRepurchase, or the date of purchase with respect to any other Pro Rata\n\nRepurchase which is not a tender offer or exchange offer) made during such\n\nperiod, exceeds twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the aggregate Fair Market\n\nValue of all shares of Common Stock outstanding on the day before the ex-\n\ndividend date with respect to such Extraordinary Distribution which is paid in\n\ncash and on the distribution date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution\n\nwhich is paid other than in cash.  The Fair Market Value of an Extraordinary\n\nDistribution for purposes of Section 9(D) shall be the sum of the Fair Market\n\nValue of such Extraordinary Distribution plus the aggregate amount of any cash\n\ndividends or\n\n\n\n                                      37\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\nother distributions which are not Extraordinary Distributions made during such\n\ntwelve month period and not previously included in the calculation of an\n\nadjustment pursuant to Section 9(D), but shall exclude the aggregate amount of\n\nregular quarterly dividends declared by the Board of Directors and paid by the\n\nCorporation in such twelve month period.\n\n\n\n          (2) \"Fair Market Value\" shall mean, as to shares of Common Stock or\n\nany other class of capital stock or securities of the Corporation or any other\n\nissuer which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices (as\n\nhereinafter defined) of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment\n\nPeriod (as hereinafter defined).  \"Current Market Price\" of publicly traded\n\nshares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or other security of\n\nthe Corporation or any other issuer for a day shall mean the last reported sales\n\nprice, regular way, or, in case no sale takes place on such day, the average of\n\nthe reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as\n\nreported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape or, if such security is\n\nnot listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on the\n\nprincipal national securities exchange on which such security is listed or\n\nadmitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national\n\nsecurities exchange, on the NASDAQ National Market System or, if such security\n\nis not quoted on such National Market System, the average of the closing bid and\n\nasked prices on each such day in the over-the-counter market as reported by\n\nNASDAQ or, if bid and asked prices for such security on each such day shall not\n\nhave been reported through NASDAQ, the average of the bid and asked prices for\n\nsuch day as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm regularly\n\nmaking a market in such security selected for such purpose by the Board of\n\nDirectors of the Corporation on each trading day during the Adjustment Period.\n\n\"Adjustment Period\" shall mean the period of five consecutive trading days,\n\nselected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, during the twenty (20)\n\ntrading days preceding, and including, the date as of which the Fair Market\n\nValue of a security is to be determined.  The \"Fair Market Value\" of any\n\nsecurity which is not publicly traded or of any other property shall mean the\n\nfair value thereof as determined by an independent investment banking or\n\nappraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property\n\nselected in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or, if no\n\nsuch investment banking or appraisal firm is in the good faith judgment of the\n\nBoard of Directors available to make such determination, as determined in good\n\nfaith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n          (3) \"Non-Dilutive Amount\" in respect of an issuance, sale or exchange\n\nby the Corporation of any right or warrant to purchase or acquire shares of\n\nCommon Stock (including any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares\n\nof Common Stock) shall mean the difference between (i) the product of the Fair\n\nMarket Value of a share of Common Stock on the day preceding the first public\n\nannouncement of such issuance, sale or exchange multiplied by the maximum number\n\nof shares of Common Stock which could be acquired on such date upon the exercise\n\nin full of such rights or warrants (including upon the conversion or exchange of\n\nall such convertible or exchangeable securities), whether or not exercisable (or\n\nconvertible or exchangeable) at such date, and (ii) the aggregate amount payable\n\npursuant to such right or warrant to purchase or acquire such maximum number of\n\nshares of Common Stock; provided, however, that in no event shall the Non-\n\nDilutive Amount be less than zero.  For purposes of the foregoing sentence, in\n\nthe case of a security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common\n\nStock, the amount payable pursuant to a right or warrant to purchase or acquire\n\nshares of Common Stock shall be the Fair Market Value of such security on the\n\ndate of the issuance, sale or exchange of such security by the Corporation.\n\n\n\n                                      38\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n          (4) \"Pro Rata Repurchase\" shall mean any purchase of shares of Common\n\nStock by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, whether for cash, shares of\n\ncapital stock of the Corporation, other securities of the Corporation, evidences\n\nof indebtedness of the Corporation or any other person or any other property\n\n(including shares of a subsidiary of the Corporation ), or any combination\n\nthereof, effected while any of the shares of Class B Preferred Stock are\n\noutstanding, pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer subject to Section\n\n13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"),\n\nor any successor provision of law, or pursuant to any other offer available to\n\nsubstantially all holders of Common Stock, provided, however, that no purchase\n\nof shares by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof made in open market\n\ntransactions shall be deemed a Pro Rata Repurchase.  For purposes of this\n\nSection 9(G), shares shall be deemed to have been purchased by the Corporation\n\nor any subsidiary thereof \"in open market transactions\" if they have been\n\npurchased substantially in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as in\n\neffect under the Exchange Act on the date shares of Class B Preferred Stock are\n\ninitially issued by the Corporation or on such other terms and conditions as the\n\nBoard of Directors of the Corporation shall have determined are reasonably\n\ndesigned to prevent such purchases from having a material effect on the trading\n\nmarket for the Common Stock.\n\n\n\n          (H) Whenever an adjustment increasing the number of shares of Class B\n\nPreferred Stock outstanding is required pursuant hereto, the Board of Directors\n\nshall take action as is necessary so that a sufficient number of shares of Class\n\nB Preferred Stock are designated with respect to such increase resulting from\n\nsuch adjustment.  Whenever an adjustment to the Conversion Price, the\n\nLiquidation Price or the Regular Preferred Dividend Rate of the Class B\n\nPreferred Stock is required pursuant hereto, the Corporation shall forthwith\n\nplace on file with the transfer agent for the Common Stock and the Class B\n\nPreferred Stock, if there be one, and with the Treasurer of the Corporation, a\n\nstatement signed by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation\n\nstating the adjusted Conversion Price, Liquidation Price and Regular Preferred\n\nDividend Rate determined as provided herein.  Such statement shall set forth in\n\nreasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason and the\n\nmanner of computing such adjustment, including any determination of Fair Market\n\nValue involved in such computation.  Promptly after each adjustment to the\n\nnumber of shares of Class B Preferred Stock outstanding, the Conversion Price,\n\nthe Liquidation Price or the Regular Preferred Dividend Rate, the Corporation\n\nshall mail a notice thereof and of the then prevailing number of shares of Class\n\nB Preferred Stock outstanding, the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and\n\nthe Regular Preferred Dividend Rate to each holder of shares of Class B\n\nPreferred Stock.\n\n\n\n     10.
