Indemnification.\n\n\n\n              11.1   General.  Each person who was or is made a party to or\n\nthreatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or\n\nproceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including\n\na grand jury proceeding and an action by the Corporation (individually, a\n\n\"Proceeding\") by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or\n\nshe is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the\n\nCorporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a\n\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a\n\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with\n\nrespect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is\n\nalleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or\n\nagent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee\n\nor agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the\n\nfullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same\n\nexists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,\n\nonly to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide\n\nbroader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to\n\nprovide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss\n\n(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes under the Employee\n\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 or penalties and amounts paid or to be\n\npaid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in\n\nconnection with the Proceeding (collectively, \"Covered Expenses\") and such\n\nindemnification shall continue as to the person who has ceased to be a\n\ndirector, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or\n\nher heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as\n\nprovided in Paragraph 11.2, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person\n\nseeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof)\n\ninitiated by such person only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was\n\nauthorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to\n\nindemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and shall\n\ninclude the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in\n\ndefending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,\n\nhowever, that if required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the payment\n\nof such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a\n\ndirector or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is\n\nrendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without\n\nlimitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final\n\ndisposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation\n\nof an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all\n\namounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or\n\nofficer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise.  The\n\nCorporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification\n\nto employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as\n\nthe foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.\n\n\n\n              11.2   Failure to Pay Claims.  If a claim under Paragraph 11.1 is\n\nnot paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after the\n\nCorporation has received a written claim, the claimant may at any time\n\nthereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of\n\nthe claim and, if successful in whole or part, the claimant shall be entitled\n\nto be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense\n\nto any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for\n\nexpenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final\n\ndisposition when the required undertaking, if any is required, has been\n\ntendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of\n\nconduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law\n\nfor the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the\n\nburden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure\n\nof the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel\n\nor its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of\n\nsuch action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances\n\nbecause he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the\n\nDelaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\n\n\n<PAGE>   9\n\nCorporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its\n\nstockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of\n\nconduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the\n\nclaimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.\n\n\n\n              11.3   Not Exclusive.  The right to indemnification and the\n\npayment of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final\n\ndisposition conferred in this Article 11 shall not be exclusive of any other\n\nright which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,\n\nprovision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,\n\nbylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.\n\n\n\n              11.4   Insurance.  The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its\n\nexpense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the\n\nCorporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other\n\nenterprise against any Covered Expenses, whether or not the Corporation would\n\nhave the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss\n\nunder the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n\n\n\n              11.5   Definition of the Corporation.  As used in this Article,\n\nreferences to \"the Corporation\" shall include, in addition to the resulting or\n\nsurviving corporation, any constituent corporation absorbed in a consolidation\n\nor merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power\n\nand authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees and agents, so\n\nthat any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such\n\nconstituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such\n\nconstituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another\n\ncorporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand\n\nin the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the\n\nresulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such\n\nconstituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.\n\n\n\n              11.6   Severability.  If this Article or any portion hereof shall\n\nbe invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the\n\nCorporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee and\n\nagent of the Corporation as to any Covered Expenses to the fullest extent\n\npermitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been\n\ninvalidated or by any other applicable law.\n\n\n\n       12.
