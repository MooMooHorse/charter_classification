The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,\n\norder, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its\n\nequivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not\n\nact in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not\n\nopposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any\n\ncriminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his\n\nconduct was unlawful.\n\n\n\nB.

To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent has been\n\nsuccessful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or\n\nproceeding referred to in paragraph A or B of this Article, or in defense of\n\nany claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses\n\n(including attorneys\u0092 fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in\n\nconnection therewith.\n\n\n\nD.

Expenses incurred by any person who may have a right of indemnification\n\nunder this Article in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding\n\nmay be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such\n\naction, suit or proceeding as authorized by the board of directors upon\n\nreceipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person, to repay such amount\n\nunless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified\n\nby the corporation pursuant to this Article.\n\n\n\nF. The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive\n\nof any other rights to which any person may be entitled under any by-law,\n\nagreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both\n\nas to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity\n\nwhile holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to\n\nbe a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to be benefit of the\n\nheirs, executors and administrators of such a person.\n\n\n\nG.

Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased\n\nor otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be\n\nretired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof.

Following the payment of\n\nthe full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional\n\ndistributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have\n\nreceived an amount per share (the \u0093Capital Adjustment\u0094) equal to the quotient\n\nobtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 5,000\n\n(the \u0093Adjustment Number\u0094).

In the event, however, that there are not sufficient\n\nassets available to permit payment in full of the Capital Adjustment, then\n\nsuch remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common\n\nStock. Neither merger, consolidation, etc. shall be deemed to be a\n\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up for purposes of this Section 6.\n\n\n\n(C) In the event the Corporation shall (i) declare any dividend on Common\n\nStock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common\n\nStock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of\n\nshares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately\n\nprior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by\n\na fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock\n\noutstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the\n\nnumber of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to\n\nsuch event.\n\n\n\nSection 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter\n\ninto any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the\n\nshares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or\n\nsecurities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or\n\nchanged in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment\n\nhereinafter set forth) equal to 5,000 times the aggregate amount of stock,\n\nsecurities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may\n\nbe, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or\n\nexchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time (i) declare any\n\ndividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the\n\noutstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a\n\nsmaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the\n\npreceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series\n\nA Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction\n\nthe numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding\n\nimmediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of\n\nshares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to such event.\n\n\n\nSection 8. No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be\n\nredeemable.\n\n\n\nSection 9. Ranking. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all\n\nother series of the Corporation\u0092s Preferred Stock as to the payment of\n\ndividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series\n\nshall provide otherwise.\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSection 10. Amendment. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation\n\nshall not be further amended in any manner which would materially alter or\n\nchange the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred\n\nStock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the\n\nholders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred\n\nStock, voting separately as a class.\n\n\n\nSigned on the 30th day of June, 2005.\n\n\n\n|  |  \n\n---|---|---  \n\n  \n\nNUCOR CORPORATION  \n\n  \n\nBy:\n\n\n\n|  |\n\n\n\nA.
