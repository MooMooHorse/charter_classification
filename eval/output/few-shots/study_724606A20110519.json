The holder of Class A Preferred Stock shall\n\nhave optional conversion rights as follows:\n\n\n\n             (i) Right to Convert.\n\n\n\n                 (A) Each share of Class A Preferred Stock shall be convertible,\n\nat the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time into the\n\nnumber of fully paid and nonassessable shares of either Class A or Class B\n\nCommon Stock of the Corporation as is determined by dividing the Initial\n\nPreferred Purchase Price by the Current Conversion Price (as defined in\n\nsubsection (f)(iii) hereof) therefor in effect at the time of conversion.\n\n\n\n                 (B) No fractional shares of Class B Common Stock shall be\n\nissued upon any optional conversion of shares of Class A Preferred Stock. In\n\nlieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled\n\nafter determination of the aggregate full number of shares of Class B Common\n\nStock issuable in respect of the Class A Preferred Stock then being converted,\n\nthe Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then\n\napplicable Current Conversion Price.\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\n\n\n\n\n     (C)  If at any time or from time to time there shall be any Merger of the\n\nCorporation, then, provided that the election described in the last paragraph of\n\nthis subsection (f)(i)(C) is made, as a part of such Merger, provision shall be\n\nmade so that the holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall thereafter each be\n\nentitled to receive, upon conversion of each share of the Class A Preferred\n\nStock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the\n\nCorporation, or of the successor Corporation resulting from such Merger, to\n\nwhich a holder of the amount of Class B Common Stock deliverable upon conversion\n\nof such share of Class A Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such\n\nMerger. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the\n\napplication of the provisions of this subsection (f) with respect to the rights\n\nof the holders of the Class A Preferred Stock after such Merger to the end that\n\nthe provisions of this subsection (f) (including adjustment of the Current\n\nConversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchaseable upon\n\nconversion of the class A Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after such Merger\n\nin as nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable.\n\n\n\n     Each holder of Class A Preferred Stock shall have the right to elect\n\ntreatment under this subsection (f)(i)(C) in lieu of subsection (e) hereof,\n\nsuch election to be exercisable by written notice delivered to the Corporation\n\nno later than three days prior to the closing of such Merger.\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n                                     - 11 -\n\n\n\n\n\n     (ii)  Mechanics of Conversion.  (A)  In order for a holder of Class A\n\nPreferred Stock to convert shares of Class A Preferred Stock held by him or it\n\ninto shares of Class B Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the\n\ncertificate(s) for such shares of Class A Preferred Stock at the office of the\n\ntransfer agent for Class A Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the\n\nCorporation, if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with\n\nwritten notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the\n\nshares of Class A Preferred Stock represented by such certificate(s) and\n\ndesignating the class of Common Stock into which such Class A Preferred Stock is\n\nto be converted. Such notice shall state such holder's name or the names of\n\nnominees in which such holder wishes the certificate(s) for shares of Common\n\nStock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for\n\nconversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or\n\ninstruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed\n\nby the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The\n\ndate of receipt of such certificate(s) and notice by the transfer agent (or by\n\nthe Corporation, if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) shall be\n\nthe conversion date (the \"Option Conversion Date\"). The Corporation shall, as\n\nsoon as practicable after the Optional Conversion Date, issue and deliver at\n\nsuch office to such holder of Class A Preferred Stock, or to his or its\n\nnominees, a certificate or certificates for the\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber of whole shares of Common Stock (and a certificate or certificates for\n\nany shares of Class A Preferred Stock represented by the certificate(s)\n\ndelivered to the Corporation by the holder thereof which are not converted into\n\nCommon Stock) issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions\n\nhereof, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares calculated in\n\naccordance with subsection (f)(i)(B) hereof.\n\n\n\n               (B)  The Corporation shall at all times when the Class A\n\nPreferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its\n\nauthorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of\n\nthe Class A Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of\n\nCommon Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion\n\nof all outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock. Before taking any action\n\nwhich would cause Common Stock, upon the conversion of Class A Preferred Stock,\n\nto be issued below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock, the\n\nCorporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its\n\ncounsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally\n\nissue fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Common Stock to the holders of\n\nClass A Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n               (C)  Upon any optional conversion of Class A Preferred Stock,\n\nany declared but unpaid dividends on the Class A Preferred Stock shall be paid\n\non shares thereof surrendered for conversion.\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\n\n\n\n\n               (D)  All shares of Class A Preferred Stock which shall have been\n\nsurrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be\n\noutstanding, and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights,\n\nif any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on\n\nthe Optional Conversion Date, except only the right of the holders thereof to\n\nreceive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and the right to receive any\n\ndeclared but unpaid dividends thereon in accordance with subsection (f)(ii)(C)\n\nhereof. On and as of the Optional Conversion Date, the shares of Common Stock\n\nissuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to be outstanding, and the holder\n\nthereof shall be entitled to exercise and enjoy all rights with respect to such\n\nshares of Common Stock, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to\n\nvote. All certificates representing such shares of Class A Preferred Stock, from\n\nand after the Optional Conversion Date, shall be deemed to have been retired and\n\ncancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation may thereafter take\n\nsuch appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce accordingly the authorized\n\nnumber of shares of Class A Preferred Stock.\n\n\n\n          (iii)  Adjustments to Conversion Price. The conversion price for each\n\nshare of Class A Preferred Stock shall initially be $4.50. Such initial\n\nconversion price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time after the\n\nEffective Date, and each such conversion price as adjusted shall likewise be\n\n<PAGE>\n\n                                     - 14 -\n\n\n\nsubject to further adjustment, all as hereinafter set forth.

Indemnification.\n\n\n\n          10.1  The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party\n\nor witness, or is threatened to be made a party or\n\n<PAGE>\n\n                                     - 29 -\n\n\n\n\n\nwitness, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding\n\n(including, without limitation, an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right\n\nof the Corporation), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative\n\n(including a grand jury proceeding), by reason of the fact that he or she (a) is\n\nor was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or, (b) as a\n\nDirector, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at\n\nthe request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee, agent, partner\n\nor trustee (or in any similar position) of another corporation, partnership,\n\njoint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, to the fullest\n\nextent authorized or permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware and\n\nany other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but,\n\nin the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment\n\npermits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law\n\npermitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against expenses\n\n(including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement\n\nactually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action,\n\nsuit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal thereof; provided,\n\nhowever, that, except as provided in Section 10.2 hereof with respect to\n\nproceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall\n\nindemnify any such person in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or\n\npart thereof) initiated by such person only if the initiation\n\n<PAGE>\n\n                                     - 30 -\n\n\n\nof such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the\n\nBoard of Directors. Such right to indemnification shall include the right to\n\npayment by the Corporation of expenses incurred in connection with any such\n\naction, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,\n\nhowever, that the payment of such expenses incurred by a Director, officer,\n\nemployee or agent in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or\n\nproceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an\n\nundertaking, by or on behalf of such Director, officer, employee or agent, to\n\nrepay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that such\n\nDirector, officer, employee or agent is not entitled to be indemnified under\n\nthis Section 10 or otherwise.\n\n\n\n     10.2  Any indemnification or advancement of expenses required under this\n\nSection 10 shall be made promptly, and in any event within sixty days, upon the\n\nwritten request of the person entitled thereto. If a determination by the\n\nCorporation that the person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this\n\nSection 10 is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days\n\nto a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have\n\napproved such request. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnity\n\nor advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant\n\nto such request is not made within sixty days, the right to indemnification and\n\nadvancement of expenses as granted by this Section 10 shall be\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 31 -\n\n\n\nenforceable by the person in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person's\n\ncosts and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or\n\nher right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action or\n\nproceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense\n\nto any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the\n\nadvancement of expenses pursuant to this Section 10 where the required\n\nundertaking has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met\n\nthe standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware,\n\nbut the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the\n\nfailure of the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal\n\ncounsel or the stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the\n\ncommencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in\n\nthe circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct\n\nset forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor the fact that there\n\nhas been an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board of\n\nDirectors, independent legal counsel or the stockholders) that the claimant has\n\nnot met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or\n\ncreate a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of\n\nconduct.\n\n\n\n     10.3.  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or\n\ngranted pursuant to, this Section 10 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other\n\nrights to which those seeking\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 32 -\n\n\n\nindemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw,\n\nagreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both\n\nas to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another\n\ncapacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has\n\nceased to be a Director, officer, employee or agent, and shall inure to the\n\nbenefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Any repeal\n\nor modification of the provisions of this Section 10 shall not affect any\n\nobligations of the Corporation or any rights regarding indemnification and\n\nadvancement of expenses of a Director, officer, employee or agent with respect\n\nto any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding for which\n\nindemnification or the advancement of expenses is requested, in which the\n\nalleged cause of action accrued at any time prior to such repeal or\n\nmodification.\n\n\n\n     10.4  The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense,\n\nto protect itself and any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee\n\nor agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the\n\ncorporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation,\n\npartnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise\n\nagainst any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in\n\nany such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not\n\nthe Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such\n\nliability under the\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\n\n\n\n\nprovisions of this Section 10, the General Corporation Law of Delaware or\n\notherwise.\n\n\n\n     10.5 If this Section 10 or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on\n\nany ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall\n\nnevertheless indemnify each Director, officer, employee and agent of the\n\nCorporation as to expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and\n\namounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding,\n\nwhether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including, without\n\nlimitation, a grand jury proceeding and an action, suit or proceeding by or in\n\nthe right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable\n\nportion of this Section 10 that shall not have been invalidated, by the General\n\nCorporation Law of Delaware or by any other applicable law.\n\n\n\n     11.  Pricing Provisions. In the event of any merger or consolidation of\n\nthe Corporation with any other corporation or the merger of any other\n\ncorporation into the Corporation or any of its \"affiliates\", as defined in Rule\n\n12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of\n\n1934 as in effect from time to time, or any successor provision, such\n\ntransaction shall not be consummated unless each of the Corporation's\n\nstockholders shall receive incident to the consummation of any such\n\ntransaction, if they so elect, a price for their shares of stock in the company\n\nwhich shall not be less than the highest price previously paid by such other\n\ncorporation for any shares of\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Corporation's stock of that class. Such price shall be paid in the same\n\nmedium of payment paid to the stockholder receiving the highest price paid as\n\naforesaid, and shall be paid at the time of consummation of the subject\n\ntransaction to each electing stockholder.\n\n\n\n     12.  Election of Directors. The Directors shall be chosen as provided\n\nhereinafter at the annual meeting of stockholders by such stockholders as have\n\nthe right to vote thereon, and each shall hold office until the next election of\n\nDirectors of his class, as provided below, and until his successor is chosen and\n\nqualified or until he sooner dies, resigns, is removed, or becomes disqualified.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in\n\nnumber as may be, with the initial term of office of Class I expiring at the\n\nannual meeting of stockholders in 1989, of Class II expiring at the annual\n\nmeeting of stockholders in 1990, and of Class III expiring at the annual meeting\n\nof shareholders in 1991.\n\n\n\n     At each annual meeting of stockholders, Directors chosen to succeed those\n\nwhose terms then expire shall be elected for a full term of office expiring at\n\nthe third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election. In the\n\ninterim between annual meetings of stockholders or of special meetings of\n\nstockholders called for the election of Directors and/or for the removal of one\n\nor more Directors and for the filling of any vacancy in that connection, newly\n\ncreated Directorships and any vacancies in the\n\n<PAGE>\n\n                                     - 35 -\n\n\n\nBoard of Directors, including vacancies resulting from the removal of\n\n\n\nDirectors for cause, may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining\n\n\n\nDirectors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining\n\n\n\nDirector. A Director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the balance of\n\n\n\nthe term which he has been elected to fill, even though that term may extend\n\n\n\nbeyond the next annual meeting of stockholders.\n\n\n\n     Subject to the foregoing, Directors elected to fill a vacancy shall hold\n\n\n\noffice for a term expiring at the annual meeting at which the term of the class\n\n\n\nto which they shall have been elected expires. No decrease in the number of\n\n\n\nDirectors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any\n\n\n\nincumbent Director. The stockholders of the corporation are expressly prohibited\n\n\n\nfrom cumulating their votes in any election of Directors of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n     13. Amendments. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change\n\n\n\nor repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the\n\n\n\nmanner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon\n\n\n\nstockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.\n\n\n\n     WE, THE UNDERSIGNED, being each of the incorporators hereinbefore named,\n\n\n\nfor the purpose of forming a Corporation pursuant to the General Corporation Law\n\n\n\nof the State of Delaware, do make this certificate, hereby declaring and\n\n\n\ncertifying that this is our act and deed and the facts herein stated are true,\n\n\n\nand\n\n<PAGE>\n\n                                      -36-\n\n\n\n\n\naccordingly have hereunto set our hands this 1st day of June, 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                   /s/  P.
