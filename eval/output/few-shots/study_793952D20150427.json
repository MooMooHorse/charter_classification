The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n\nshall continue to have the right to elect directors as provided by the\n\nimmediately preceding sentence until all accrued and unpaid Preferential\n\nDividends upon the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have\n\nbeen paid (or set aside for payment) in full. Such directors may be removed and\n\nreplaced by such shareholders, and vacancies in such directorships may be filled\n\nonly by such shareholders (or by the remaining director elected by such\n\nshareholders, if there be one) in the manner permitted by law.\n\n\n\n          (D) Except as otherwise required by law or set forth herein, holders\n\nof Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their\n\nconsent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote\n\nwith holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for the taking of any\n\ncorporate action.\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n          Section 4.

dividend or other distribution or otherwise (a\n\n\"TRANSACTION\"), then and in each such event the dividend rights, voting rights\n\nand rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation of\n\nthe shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted so that after such\n\nevent the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled, in respect of\n\neach share of Series A Preferred Stock held, in addition to such rights in\n\nrespect thereof to which such holder was entitled immediately prior to such\n\nadjustment, to (i) such additional dividends as equal the

the receipt in the Transaction of such capital stock, (ii)\n\nsuch additional voting rights as equal the Vote Multiple in effect immediately\n\nprior to such Transaction multiplied by the additional

holder was entitled immediately prior to such event, to receive (i) such\n\nadditional dividends as equal the Dividend Multiple in effect immediately prior\n\nto such event multiplied, first, by the additional dividends to which the holder\n\nof a share of Common Stock shall be entitled upon exercise of such right or\n\nwarrant by virtue of the capital stock which could be acquired upon such\n\nexercise and multiplied again by the Discount Fraction (as hereinafter defined)\n\nand (ii) such additional voting rights as equal the Vote Multiple in effect\n\nimmediately prior to such event multiplied, first, by the additional voting\n\nrights to which the holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled upon\n\nexercise of such right or warrant by virtue of the capital stock

If the shares are\n\nnot publicly held or not so listed or traded on any day within the period of 30\n\nTrading Days applicable to the determination of Current Market Price thereof as\n\naforesaid, \"Current Market Price\" shall mean the fair market value thereof per\n\nshare as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.\n\nIn either case referred to in the foregoing sentence, the determination of\n\nCurrent Market Price shall be described in a statement filed with the Secretary\n\nof the Corporation.\n\n\n\n          Section 8.
